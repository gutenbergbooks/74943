<h2 class="nobreak">PREFACE.</h2>
</div>


<p>“<span class="smcap">Isles of the Sea</span>” is the sixth and last volume of the second
series of “Young America Abroad,” and contains the history of
the academy squadron during its voyage, “homeward bound,”
across the Atlantic. The title of the book, “Isles of the Sea,”
indicates the character of the foreign travel in which the students
of the institution were engaged; and in the pursuit of knowledge
they visit the Madeira Islands, the Canaries, the Azores, the Bermudas,
and one vessel of the fleet extends its cruise to the Cape
Verd Islands. As in its predecessors, the professor of geography
and history has something to say about each of the islands visited,
and the surgeon and sanitary officer continues to enlighten the
young gentlemen who seek his companionship in their rambles on
shore. The field of geography and history is not so extensive as
in the preceding volumes of the series; and for this reason the
story occupies a larger place in the book.</p>

<p>Of the story, Mr. Tom Speers is the central figure, or at least
one of the most prominent characters. Possibly he may be deemed
a rather eccentric character for one under age; but, as the author
has so often expressed himself before, it does not so much matter
what else a young man may be, if he only has high aims, and a
resolute purpose to carry out his ideal of what is noble, good, and
true. Tom is a high-toned young man, as are all the other characters
with whom the young reader is at all likely to sympathize,
and in whose fortunes he is most certain to be interested.</p>

<p>As to the innate probability of a few of the leading incidents,
they are suggested by actual occurrences in maritime history, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
may be recalled by those who have kept themselves familiar with
the subject. In regard to the long search of the Ville d’Angers
for the academy squadron, which extended nearly across the Atlantic,
the recorded experience of those who have traversed the ocean
on similar ventures shows how difficult it is, away from the telegraph
and the ship-news, for one vessel to find another.</p>

<p>The first volume of the first series of “Young America Abroad”
was published in 1866, by the publishers whose imprint is on the
present and last of the series. It is therefore eleven years that
the author has been engaged in this pleasing work. These books
have been received with a degree of favor which the writer is
proud and happy to acknowledge, and for which he returns his
sincere thanks. He is especially grateful that his life has been
spared to complete the work begun; and every year has increased
his interest in the host of young friends to whom these books
have introduced him in all parts of the country. He regrets, that,
in this particular field of travel and adventure, his task has reached
its conclusion. He has crossed the Atlantic four times, and travelled
in every country of Europe, in preparing himself for the
work; and the pleasant memories of the “lonely ocean” and the
far-distant lands he has visited will always be retained and cherished,
in their association with the multitude of young people in
whose delightful service he voyaged and travelled.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I.<br>

<small>THE TELEGRAPHIC DESPATCH.</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">“ALL hands, pipe to muster!” shouted the boatswain
of the Tritonia.</p>

<p>At the same moment the shrill whistle and the sharp
cry sounded through the American Prince and the
Josephine. The squadron was at anchor in Gibraltar
Bay; and since seven bells in the first watch, the signal,
“Assign rank,” had been displayed on the American
Prince, the flag-ship of the fleet.</p>

<p>It was the first day of April. The merit marks of
the students had been added since the last recitations,
and the offices were to be given out at eight bells.
The squadron had visited all the ports of the Spanish
Peninsula, and several trips to the interior had been
made. The fleet was to sail to Seville to witness the
scenes of Holy Week; and this excursion was to finish
the cruise, not only in the waters of Spain and Portugal,
but in those of Europe. The vessels would then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
be homeward bound, but by the way of the “Isles of
the Sea.”</p>

<p>There was no little excitement in all the vessels of
the squadron. Though the students could keep their
own reckoning tolerably well, so far as the literary
pursuits were concerned, they were wholly in the dark
in relation to the marks for seamanship, navigation,
and conduct. Some had strong hopes and expectations,
based upon their own earnest efforts; and these
were seldom greatly disappointed, though their rank
was sometimes not so high as they anticipated. But,
as a rule, the whole matter was a great mystery, which
it was not possible to find out.</p>

<p>Sometimes there would be very little change in the
rank of the officers for several months; and then
came a general turn-over of every thing. The rise
from the steerage to the cabin was almost uniformly
slow and regular, though sometimes a student jumped
over the heads of the half-dozen who had stood next
above him. This sudden elevation of an officer or
seaman had a tendency to produce bad feeling among
his rivals in the race for honors, for the boys continued
to be human in spite of the discipline of the service.</p>

<p>Possibly the interest on the present occasion was
intensified by the fact that the squadron was so soon
to sail for home; and doubtless many of the students
were thinking of the uniform in which they should be
presented to their friends on their return to the
American shores. On board of the Tritonia it was
known among the closer observers of events, that
several of the students had been putting forth extraordinary
exertions; and this circumstance fully<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
accounted for the unusual excitement of the day.
Among them was Bark Lingall, who had attempted
to run away, but had voluntarily returned. He appeared
to be thoroughly reformed, and, from one of
the most indifferent and vicious boys in the vessel,
had become a model of propriety in all things, as
well as a very diligent and faithful scholar.</p>

<p>There was a certain class of students in the steerage
of the Tritonia, as there always is in any large
company of boys, who affected to despise one who had
turned away from his evil habits and associations, and
reformed his life and character. Lingall had his trials
with this class of students; but he was resolute in his
purpose to continue in the good way. Under the influence
of Raymond, who had inspired him with the
desire to do his whole duty, he kept his temper under
his persecutions; and in no instance was he provoked
to subject himself to discipline by the jeers and taunts
of the disaffected.</p>

<p>Another student in the Tritonia, who had not distinguished
himself by any misconduct, though he had
been an easy-going fellow, suddenly began to exert
himself without any apparent stimulus for such action.
He was a high-minded boy, but rather peculiar in his
ways of thinking and doing. His name was Thomas
Speers. He was twenty years old, though he did not
show his years, and one might easily have mistaken
him for sixteen.</p>

<p>For the reason that they were doing their best in
seamanship and the studies, Bark Lingall and Tom
Speers excited a great deal of remark, not to say feeling,
among the students. Bark had one of the highest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
numbers in the vessel, which indicated that his rank
was among the lowest. He had never done any work
he could avoid doing since the first two or three
months of his service in the vessel. He had been
a conspirator against the discipline and even the
safety of the schooner, and was considered a bad boy
by the vice-principal in charge and the professors.</p>

<p>Tom Speers had no particular record. He was considered
a good fellow by the students in general; and,
though he was noted for his independence, he had
never wilfully broken the rules of the vessel. He was
a first-class seaman; and his ability as a student was
discovered to be of the highest order as soon as he
chose to exert himself.</p>

<p>While the boatswain of the Tritonia was still piping
his call to muster through the vessel, a shore-boat
approached the gangway. A man in the stern hailed
the vessel; and Marline, the adult boatswain, went
down on the accommodation steps to see what he
wanted, for visitors were not admitted at this time.</p>

<p>“Is there a man by the name of Thomas Speers on
board of this craft?” asked the man in the boat.</p>

<p>“We have a young man of that name on board,”
replied Marline.</p>

<p>“Can I see him for a moment?”</p>

<p>“For a moment you can; but he will be wanted very
soon.”</p>

<p>The boatswain returned to the deck, and, calling
Speers, sent him to the gangway. As the student had
no friends in Gibraltar, he wondered who could wish
to see him. He hastened to the steps, and went down
to the platform at the foot of them. Marline remained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
at the rail, to see that nothing improper passed between
Speers and the man; but he was called away
before the student had communicated with the boat.</p>

<p>“Telegraph despatch from San Roque,” said the messenger,
handing the document to Speers.</p>

<p>“It can’t be for me,” protested the student, surprised
that such a message should come to him. “I don’t
know any one in San Roque.”</p>

<p>“It is directed to Thomas Speers, and there is the
name of this vessel on it,” persisted the messenger,
pointing to the address. “But it is not from San
Roque the message comes: that is the nearest telegraph
station.”</p>

<p>“Where did it come from?” asked Speers, turning
the message over and over in his hand.</p>

<p>“I don’t know: you can tell by opening it.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to open it, if it is not for me.”</p>

<p>“If your name is Thomas Speers, it is for you. I
have done my errand, and I have nothing more to say
about it,” added the man, as he shoved his boat off
from the platform.</p>

<p>“All hands on deck!” shouted an officer at the gangway.</p>

<p>Speers put the message into his pocket. He seemed
to have no curiosity in regard to its contents. He was
more interested in the distribution of the offices on
board of the Tritonia; but he did not believe the message
was for him. He hastened back to the deck, and
took his station in the waist.</p>

<p>He hoped his place would be on the quarter-deck
for the new term. He had made a desperate struggle
with all his studies, and he was not conscious that he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
had failed in any thing. Mr. Pelham, the vice-principal,
took his position at the heel of the mainmast, with the
list of officers and seamen in his hand. Most of the
students looked very anxious, though a few of the “marines”
affected to make fun of the occasion, and pretended
that they did not care what positions fell to
their lot.</p>

<p>The vice-principal made the usual introductory
speech, pointing the moral the occasion suggested.
The record for the last month indicated some very
important changes; and he hoped they would cause no
ill feeling either in the cabin or the steerage. The
merit marks strictly represented the conduct and work
of the students; and the result of the addition of the
figures had caused as much surprise among the professors
as it would among the young gentlemen.</p>

<p>Mr. Pelham then announced the name of Wainwright
as captain. This officer had held the position
for many months; and, as he was very popular on
board, the announcement was received with hearty applause.
Greenwood was first lieutenant again; and his
name was well received by the ship’s company. Scott,
who had been fourth lieutenant during the preceding
month, came in as second; and, as the joker had always
been a favorite, his promotion produced a very decided
sensation.</p>

<p>“I congratulate you, Mr. Scott,” said the vice-principal,
with a smile.</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir. For the good of the Tritonia, I
am glad this thing has happened,” replied the joker.</p>

<p>“Modesty is a cardinal virtue,” added Mr. Pelham.</p>

<p>“I know it, sir; and that is the reason I am so heavily<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
loaded with it,” returned Scott, making a face which
caused a tremendous laugh on the quarter-deck.</p>

<p>If there was anybody that did not laugh, it was Alexander,
who had formerly been first lieutenant; and his
name was not yet called. But it came in next as third
lieutenant; while O’Hara, the “Oyrish Oytalian,” was
again the fourth lieutenant.</p>

<p>“No great change in that,” said Richards, the first
master, who had been struggling for a lieutenant’s place
for months.</p>

<p>“No; but that shows the changes are yet to be mentioned,”
replied Blair, the fourth master, to whom the
remark had been addressed. “It looks as though
there was a chance for some of us to take a berth in
the steerage. Perhaps you are the one to go down,
Richards.”</p>

<p>“What makes you think so, Blair?” asked the first
speaker anxiously.</p>

<p>“I don’t think so: I have no opinion at all about it.
If there are to be great changes, some of us will have
to go down,” added Blair.</p>

<p>So it proved; but not just as the fourth master had
indicated. The vice-principal paused a long time before
he read the next name; and the hearts of many
beat violently as the moment came that might dash
down all their hopes for the present.</p>

<p>“First master,” said the vice-principal at last,
“Thomas Speers.”</p>

<p>The announcement was received in silence and in
blank amazement. The students who had observed
that Speers was making an effort thought it possible
he might be coxswain of the captain’s gig, captain of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
the after-guard, or something of that sort; but they
had not the slightest expectation that he would get into
the cabin, to say nothing of his jumping over the heads
of four masters who had been in the cabin for months.
The experience of the past demonstrated that a fellow
who once got into the cabin very seldom allowed himself
to be shoved out of it. If he had the ability to get
there, he had the ability to stay there. Besides, the
constant presence of the professors had a tendency to
stimulate him to do his best.</p>

<p>“Speers, I congratulate you on the great promotion
you have won,” said Mr. Pelham, breaking in upon the
silence into which the ship’s company had been surprised
by the mention of the name of Speers in connection,
with so high a position.</p>

<p>“I thank you, sir,” replied Tom Speers, bowing and
blushing.</p>

<p>Then came the most tumultuous applause from the
seamen in the waist. One of their own number had
gone up; and, though they had no particular sympathy
with Speers, his elevation indicated that one of the
present officers would be reduced to the steerage.
There were enough among them to rejoice at the fall
of a superior; for it was quite impossible to repress
entirely the spirit of envy and jealousy excited by the
elevation of the few above the many.</p>

<p>This subject had early attracted the attention of Mr.
Lowington, the principal of the academy squadron; and
he had done all he could to moderate and expel the feeling
among the students. But they were all human beings,
subject to the infirmities of the flesh; and they could
not be wholly different from the more mature actors on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
the stage of life. They were fully instructed and warned
in regard to the effect of cherishing this vicious spirit;
but that was all that could be done. The boys were to
meet and encounter the same circumstances in the
great world as on board of the vessels of the academy
fleet; and they received all the preparation for the
ordeal it was possible to give them.</p>

<p>“That proves that one of us will have to go down,”
said Blair, while the seamen in the waist were applauding
the promotion of Speers.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe in this thing,” added Richards, with
no little excitement in his tones and manner. “Who
ever heard of such a thing as a fellow in the steerage
leaping over the heads of all the masters?”</p>

<p>“It is done; and it’s no use to talk about it,” continued
Blair. “Speers’s marks give him that place, or
he would not have it.”</p>

<p>“There is something wrong about it.”</p>

<p>“What can be wrong?”</p>

<p>“It looks as though the books of the professors had
been doctored. Didn’t the vice-principal say it was as
great a surprise to the faculty as to fellows?”</p>

<p>“That only shows that they have had their eyes
open; and, if there was any thing wrong about the
books, they would have discovered it.”</p>

<p>“It would have been easy enough for Speers to alter
half a dozen figures on the book,” Richards insisted.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe Speers is a fellow of that sort,”
Blair objected. “If he had done such a thing, the
professors could see that the figures had been
changed.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>“I don’t understand it; and I can’t explain it in any
other way,” added Richards, shaking his head.</p>

<p>“Second master,” the vice-principal proceeded,
“Henry Raymond. He is absent, but the principal
instructs me to hold his position the same as last
month.”</p>

<p>Raymond’s absence was explained, as it was in all
the vessels of the fleet; and it was satisfactory to all
except Ben Pardee and Lon Gibbs, of the “marines,”
who had been engaged in an attempt to run away.
The vice-principal glanced at his list again, and the
students waited with intense interest for the name of
the next officer.</p>

<p>“Third master,” said he; and there was another
long pause. Blair and Richards were holding their
breath in their anxiety to hear the next name, for there
were only two chances more for the cabin.</p>

<p>“Third master,” repeated the vice-principal, “Barclay
Lingall.”</p>

<p>If the name of Tom Speers had produced a sensation
among the officers and crew, that of Bark Lingall
made a greater one. Three months before, he had run
away from the vessel with a fellow so bad that the latter
was expelled; and on his return, though he came back
of his own accord, having been reformed by the influence
of Raymond while both were absent, his lost
lessons could not be made up; and he was given the
highest number in the vessel, which placed him below
all the others. From that low position he had suddenly
risen to be the third master of the Tritonia. The
case seemed to be so singular, and so contrary to the
past experience of the students, that the vice-principal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
deemed it necessary to explain it. He took the occasion
to illustrate that almost any student who was
thoroughly in earnest in his studies could obtain any
position his ambition coveted. When he saw that
Lingall was doing so well, he anticipated a high position
for him, though not quite so high as he had attained.</p>

<p>“I am disgusted,” said Richards, when one more
chance had slipped away from him. “I feel sure that
the books have been doctored. Two fellows from the
steerage have got into the cabin.”</p>

<p>“And we are about at the end of the rope. Either
you or I must go down now, and perhaps both of us,”
replied Blair, shrugging his shoulders.</p>

<p>“That’s so; but I don’t believe we are to be sent
down by any sort of fair play,” growled Richards.</p>

<p>“There is no help for it. I don’t think I did as well
last month as I should have done if I had supposed
there was any danger of being shoved out of the
cabin,” continued Blair frankly.</p>

<p>“I have no doubt I could have done better; but I
believe now that I have done well enough to keep my
place.”</p>

<p>“What are you going to do about it? get up a mutiny?”</p>

<p>“I feel like doing something about it.”</p>

<p>“Wait a minute before you do it,” laughed Blair.
“You may be all right yet.”</p>

<p>“I can’t be any thing better than fourth master, and
below Speers and Lingall.”</p>

<p>“Fourth master,” continued the vice-principal, when
the excitement of the last announcement had in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
measure subsided; and then he paused again, not to
prolong the agony of the students, but to make sure
that no mistake was made.</p>

<p>“We shall know all about it in another minute,” said
Blair; “and you will learn whether or not you need go
on with your mutiny.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t said any thing about a mutiny: you said
that, Blair.”</p>

<p>“Mutinies don’t pay in this squadron: besides, we
shall be homeward bound in a few days,” laughed Blair.</p>

<p>“Fourth master, Richards,” read the vice-principal
from his list.</p>

<p>“There you are, Richards!” exclaimed Blair.</p>

<p>“And you are counted out,” added the new fourth
master.</p>

<p>“I am; but I shall not cry about it. You are an
officer, and I am a seaman now; and, if I conclude to
get up a mutiny at your suggestion, I shall not say any
thing to you about it.”</p>

<p>Blair shrugged his shoulders, and, making a merit of
necessity, he stepped down from the quarter-deck into
the waist. A few minutes later his name was read as
one of the highest of the petty officers. There was
not much consolation in this position, as he was turned
out of the cabin.</p>

<p>The rest of the numbers were given out in the order
of merit. As usual, there was considerable grumbling,
while not a few were elated over the rank they had
won. Before noon the officers put on their uniform,
though two of them were absent.</p>

<p>Tom Speers in his frock-coat and cap was a good-looking
officer. He was well received by the other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
occupants of the cabin,—possibly with the exception of
Richards, who could not wholly forgive him for getting
above him. Tom had quite forgotten the telegraphic
despatch he had received, till he put on his uniform,
and changed the contents of his pockets into those of
the new dress.</p>

<p>He was not much interested in the document: his
big promotion monopolized all his thoughts. He had
no time to look at it; for, as soon as the rank was assigned
in the squadron, the signal for sailing appeared
on the American Prince. When the fleet was under
way, the second part of the port-watch to which Tom
Speers belonged was off duty, the first part being in
charge of the vessel.</p>

<p>O’Hara, the fourth lieutenant, was his associate
watch-officer. The Irish Italian had treated him very
handsomely from the moment the rank of the new-comer
into the cabin was announced. They were to
spend days and nights together in charge of the deck,
and it was pleasant to be on good terms with each
other. They had a long talk together as soon as the
Tritonia was clear of the Bay of Gibraltar.</p>

<p>While they were thus engaged, Speers took from his
pocket the telegraph despatch, which got into his hand
by accident rather than by design. He had been too
much interested in the conversation with O’Hara to
think of it before. He took it from his pocket that he
might not forget it again, and not with the intention of
opening it in the presence of his companion; but it
attracted the attention of the fourth lieutenant.</p>

<p>“What have you there, Speers?” asked O’Hara.
“A letter from home? We have had no mail in the
ship for a fortnight.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>“No: it is not a letter,” replied Tom Speers very
indifferently.</p>

<p>“Not a letter? isn’t it in an envelope?” demanded
O’Hara, more interested in the matter than the owner
of the document.</p>

<p>“It is a telegraph despatch, which was brought to me
just as all hands were piped to muster this morning.”</p>

<p>“I hope none of your friends are sick or dead,”
added the lieutenant, with a show of sympathy.</p>

<p>“I have no near friends to die or be sick.”</p>

<p>“Who sends you the despatch, then?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know: I haven’t opened it yet.”</p>

<p>“You haven’t? What is the telegraph for but to
hurry up things? and you haven’t opened the envelope
yet!” exclaimed the impulsive young Irishman.</p>

<p>“I will open it now,” said Tom, as he broke the
seal.</p>

<p>“Faix, you are mighty cool about it,” laughed
O’Hara. “Where is it from?”</p>

<p>“From London. I will read it to you, O’Hara, if
you will keep it to yourself.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no! I don’t ask to hear what’s in it.”</p>

<p>“But I want you to hear it.”</p>

<p>“Then I will keep your secret.”</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“‘Uncle dead; letters sent: come to London quick.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Rodwood.</span>’”</p>
</div>

<p>This was the despatch.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II.<br>

<small>THE LETTER FROM LONDON.</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">“I&#8202; THOUGHT you said you had no friends to die or
be sick,” said O’Hara, when Tom Speers had read
the neglected despatch.</p>

<p>“I said I had no near friends,” explained Tom.</p>

<p>“Don’t you call your uncle a near friend, especially
if you have no others?”</p>

<p>“I should say that would depend upon circumstances.
I never lived with my uncle, and I never saw a great
deal of him. He was a very rich man: I have heard
it said that he was worth five or six millions.”</p>

<p>“Murder! what an uncle!” exclaimed O’Hara.
“Five or six millions! that’s a power of money. How
many children had he?”</p>

<p>“None at all; not a chick nor a child,” replied Tom,
amused at the manner of his companion, who always
indulged in the brogue when he was excited.</p>

<p>“Howly St. Patrick! five or six millions of money,
and not a child in the world? What has he done with
it all?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” replied Tom coolly.</p>

<p>“How many brothers and sisters had he?” asked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
O’Hara, opening his mouth with the interest he felt in
the case.</p>

<p>“None at all.”</p>

<p>“How can he be your uncle, then? That’s what
bothers me.”</p>

<p>“My father was his only brother, and they had no
sisters. My father died when I was ten years old;
and my mother died two years ago, just before I joined
the academy ship.”</p>

<p>“Begorra, then you are the heir of the five or six
millions!” shouted O’Hara, as excited as though all
the money were coming to him. “Faix, I’m glad to be
in the same watch with you! I shall make it the business
of my loife to cultivate your frindship.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think it will pay for you to do so, for I never
saw my uncle a dozen times in my life; and I am confident
he has given his money to some other person,”
answered Tom, laughing at the enthusiasm of his companion.
“He never did a thing for me, and, what is
worse, he never did a thing for my mother when she
needed help; and so it isn’t likely that he has left any
of his money for me.”</p>

<p>“Whose name is it signed to the despatch?”</p>

<p>“Rodwood; Judge Rodwood. He always was a
great crony and adviser of my uncle; and now I suppose
he is the executor or administrator.”</p>

<p>“Why should he telegraph to you if your uncle didn’t
lave you the money?” demanded O’Hara warmly.</p>

<p>“I don’t know: I may get the letters he sent before
we sail for home.”</p>

<p>“But he says you are to go to London quick; and I
shall not have you in my watch, after all.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>“Yes, you will; for I shall not go to London,” added
Tom decidedly.</p>

<p>“Howly Mother! not go, when there is five or six
millions of money waiting for you to put your hand to
it?” gasped O’Hara.</p>

<p>“I don’t know that there is even a single dollar waiting
for me; and if I knew there were a million I
wouldn’t go,” answered Tom, laughing at his friend’s
zeal.</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t! what are you made of? You are
cowlder than a frozen brickbat! What’s the rayson
you won’t go?” inquired the lieutenant.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you why. My father died worth only about
five thousand dollars. My mother kept this money for
me; and she took care of me with only an income of
three hundred and fifty dollars a year. She asked my
uncle for a little help, and he took no notice of her letter.
This was a year before she died, and she wanted
to send me to college. Then she went to see him,
thinking he might not have got the letter. He put her
off for a time; but he finally told her he would do
nothing for her. I never went to see him after that,
though he often sent for me. He did not like my
mother, and he never invited her to his house.</p>

<p>“After my mother died, I made up my mind that I
wanted to go to sea, and work my way up to be captain
of a ship. My mother’s brother was my guardian, and
he consented to use my little fortune in paying my expenses
in this institution. Now I am here; and I have
just got waked up as I never was before. At one
bound, I have become first master of the Tritonia. I
like the berth; and I am going to do a great deal better<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
than I have yet. Now, do you think I will leave
this high place in the vessel at the call of one I don’t
care a straw about? I never even saw Judge Rodwood,
though I have heard enough about him.”</p>

<p>“He may be your guardian under the will.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care if he is: I have only one guardian
that I know any thing about, and that’s my uncle on
my mother’s side. I like this situation too well to leave
it,” continued Tom, independent as a basket of chips.</p>

<p>“But the money?” suggested O’Hara.</p>

<p>“I don’t know that my rich uncle has left me any
money; and, in fact, I don’t care if he has. I have not
quite forgiven him for refusing to help my mother.”</p>

<p>“You might take his money, whether you forgive him
or not.”</p>

<p>“Now he is dead, I am willing to forgive him; but I
don’t ask any favors of him or his estate.”</p>

<p>“Faix, you are moighty indepindint.”</p>

<p>“I love the Tritonia with all my heart just now;
and I wouldn’t leave her for filthy lucre any more than
I would cast off the girl that loved me for it. Judge
Rodwood is a great boatman, and has a steam-yacht,
though I believe my uncle owned it; so that I might
have a chance to go to sea in good shape if I went to
him. But I like my place on board this vessel better;
and I mean to stay here as long as I can. I have told
you all about my affairs, O’Hara; and now you will not
blow on me, will you?”</p>

<p>“Faix, I won’t, thin! Not a word shall pass my
lips,” protested the warm-hearted Irishman.</p>

<p>“If the vice-principal should see this message, or
hear of it, he would tell Mr. Lowington; and he might<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
make me go to London, whether I am willing or not,”
added Tom rather anxiously.</p>

<p>“I’m sure he would make you go to London for your
own good. But not a word will I spake till I have
your permission to do so.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, O’Hara: I am sure we shall be good
friends.”</p>

<p>“You may bet your life on that! You are a broth
of a boy, with five or six millions, more or less, in your
trousers-pocket; and you may depind upon it, I’ll stick
to you like a brother,” said O’Hara, with a wild laugh.</p>

<p>“Don’t consider me an heir till we have further
information. But we were very good friends before I
read this message to you.”</p>

<p>“Faix, we were!”</p>

<p>The conversation was continued till the two officers
were called to attend to their duties, when the first part
of the watch was relieved. The following week was
spent at Seville, and then the squadron returned to
Gibraltar. The vessels had hardly anchored before
Mr. Lowington’s agent came off with a mail for the
students and others on board. There was a letter for
Tom Speers.</p>

<p>He put it into his pocket without stopping to read it,
though not till he had seen that the post-mark was
London. This was the letter alluded to in the telegraphic
despatch; and doubtless it contained full particulars
of the death of his uncle, and an explanation
of the reason why he was summoned to London. Tom
was not inclined to read it, for he did not wish to be
told of any thing that would call him away from the
Tritonia. His ambition was thoroughly aroused, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
he was resolved to win the highest position in the
vessel.</p>

<p>All who had received letters from home were busy
reading them, and the discipline of the squadron was
sufficiently relaxed to permit them to do so without
interruption; but Tom Speers put his letter into his
pocket. O’Hara had news from home, and he was busy
digesting it, so that he could not speak to him about
his affairs. He felt the need of counsel, while he
dreaded to receive it lest it should oblige him to abandon
the Tritonia and the brilliant hopes of the future.</p>

<p>Perhaps his uncle had left him a fortune, for there
were a dozen fortunes in the vast pile of wealth the
dead man had left behind him. It was even probable,
in Tom’s estimation, that he had done so, for he had
been named after his uncle; and, if he did not care for
his nephew, he might desire to have his name live after
he could no longer bear it except upon the costly monument
that marked his last resting-place. The young
man felt no deep affection for his uncle, and had no
great respect for his memory. A few thousands given
to his mother while she was pinching herself to bring
up her boy would have been better than as many hundred
thousands to him now that she was gone.</p>

<p>Tom felt that he was alone in the world, and he had
only to look out for himself. While he cherished no
spite or ill-will towards his departed uncle, he did not
quite like the idea of being made a rich man by his
bounty. He was very proud and independent; and to
accept a fortune from his uncle, seemed almost like
treachery to his mother. It was the sentimentalism of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
the young man, which a few years of contact with the
world would obliterate.</p>

<p>The letter from Judge Rodwood was in his pocket,
and it seemed to burn there. He was curious to know
its contents, but he did not wish to be influenced by
any thing it might contain. He did not like to be
tempted by wealth to give up his present ambitious
prospects. He thought every minute, as he looked at
his shipmates reading their letters from home, that he
would open the one from the judge; but he did not.
He sat upon the quarter-deck, gazing listlessly at all
the objects in sight, from the lofty rock bristling with
guns and batteries, to the scenes which were transpiring
on board of the schooner; but he could not decide
to do any thing to settle the present problem of existence.</p>

<p>He had made up his mind to be a sailor. He had
longed for a “life on the ocean wave” since he was
a small boy, and read the tales of the sea; but his
devotion to his mother did not permit him to mention
the subject after he had observed her shudder when
he alluded to it for the first and last time. But he had
dreamed, all the time, of roaming the seas, and visiting
the distant lands of the earth. He had put himself
in the way to realize these visions as soon as he
had in a measure recovered from the deep grief occasioned
by the death of his mother. Now, when he had
almost reached the pinnacle of his hopes, came this
command of his uncle’s executor—as he supposed the
judge was—to abandon his delightful mission.</p>

<p>But Judge Rodwood was not his guardian, so far as
he knew; and he was not willing to recognize his right<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
to order him to London. Perry Bowman, his mother’s
brother, was all the guardian he could recognize. This
gentleman had possession of his little fortune, or what
was left of it; for his expenses in the academy squadron
had already absorbed a considerable portion of the
principal, besides the income.</p>

<p>While he was thinking of the subject, unable to
come to a decision in regard to the letter, which he
was confident was a repetition of the order for him to
hasten to London, he saw a boat leave the American
Prince, and pull first to the Josephine, and then to
the Tritonia. The officer in charge of it delivered
a note to each vice-principal, and then returned to the
steamer, which was still taking in coal at the station.</p>

<p>All the preparation for the voyage among “The Isles
of the Sea” had been completed on board of the two
consorts. All the water-tanks and spare casks had
been filled with water, and an abundance of fresh and
salt provisions had been taken on board. The compasses
had been adjusted, and the chronometers had
been regulated; and every thing was in readiness for
sailing at a moment’s notice, though the steamer would
not have received all her coal till after dark.</p>

<p>The boat which brought the note had hardly returned
to the flag-ship before the signal for sailing appeared
at the mainmast of the Tritonia. Word was passed
along among the officers, that the two schooners would
sail at ten, leaving the American Prince to follow in
the evening.</p>

<p>“We are off in ten minutes,” said O’Hara, disturbing
the meditations of Tom Speers, as soon as the
news had been circulated among the students.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>“I am not sorry that we are not to wait all day in
port for the steamer,” replied Tom. “You have had
letters from home, O’Hara. I hope your friends are
all well.”</p>

<p>“First class,” replied the fourth lieutenant. “And
did you get the letters from London of which you were
advised in the despatch?”</p>

<p>“I got one letter, but it is a very thick one, and very
likely the envelope contains two or three of them.”</p>

<p>“Well, what is it all about? How much money has
your uncle left you?” asked O’Hara glibly, but with
deep interest manifested in his bright eyes.</p>

<p>“I don’t know: I haven’t opened the letter yet,”
replied Tom, with a smile.</p>

<p>“Haven’t opened it!” exclaimed the lieutenant,
holding up both hands in amazement. “Upon my
sowl, you are a lunatic, Speers! you haven’t a head
upon your shoulders at all, at all!”</p>

<p>“Now, I think I have,” added Tom, laughing
heartily at the earnestness of his companion. “Did
you open your letters?”</p>

<p>“To be sure I did.”</p>

<p>“Why did you open them?”</p>

<p>“Why did I open them? Howly Mother, what a
question! Why did I open them? To see what was
in them. What else would I open them for?”</p>

<p>“For nothing else. You wanted to know what was
in them; and the right thing for you to do was to open
them. I don’t want to know what is in mine; and for
that reason I don’t open them. Isn’t my way of doing
it just as sensible as yours?” demanded Tom, satisfied
with his logic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>“You don’t want to know what is in them! By the
powers, that’s the rayson why you are a lunatic! I
don’t know but I ought to report you to the vice-principal
before we sail, that you may have proper medical
tratement before we get out of the raych of the
docther.”</p>

<p>“Don’t do that, if you please, O’Hara,” said Tom
earnestly. “I told you the reason why I did not wish
to be sent to London.”</p>

<p>“Never you fear. Sure, it’s joking I was. I
wouldn’t mutther the first taste of a sound to bother
you; but, upon my sowl, you are the quayrest boy I
ever met in the whole course of my life. You don’t
care a straw how much money your rich uncle has left
you!”</p>

<p>“I don’t think I do. If he had given my poor
mother a hundredth part of his big fortune when she
was alive, I would have blessed his memory, and
heeded his slightest wish, alive or dead.”</p>

<p>“Then the executor of your uncle must go down on
his knees, and beg you to take the fortune he has left
you!” exclaimed the lieutenant. “If you don’t want
it yourself, take the money, and hand it over to the
poor, myself among the number.”</p>

<p>“I suppose I shall take whatever my uncle has left
me; and I shall try to make a good use of it. But
when I came into the academy squadron, I had made
up my mind that I would be the architect of my own
fortunes. I came here to learn the arts of seamanship
and navigation as the means to earn my own living. I
don’t feel like turning away from my plan yet. I love
the sea.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>“But with all the money your uncle will leave you,
can’t you sail all over the world in your own yacht;
and that yacht a steamer like the American Prince, or
a full-rigged ship like the Young America? What are
you talking about?”</p>

<p>“But I want to finish my course in the Tritonia;
and, if you won’t laugh at me, I mean to be the captain
of her before she reaches the shores of the United
States,” said Tom, with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>“Oh, murther! is that what’s the matter wid you?”
ejaculated O’Hara, with a laugh. “I had that same
fayver; and, when I first got into the Tritonia, I
said to myself that I would be the captain of her in
six months; and now it’s more than a year I’m in her,
and I’m only fourth lieutenant.”</p>

<p>“If I fail, I fail; but I shall do all I can to win the
position.”</p>

<p>“But don’t be a lunatic any longer! Open the letter,
and see what’s the matter. Faix I’m dying with
curiosity to know what’s in it,” continued the lieutenant.</p>

<p>“One reason why I did not open it before was that
I wanted to talk with you about it; for I believe you
are the best friend I have in the ship,” said Tom earnestly;
for he had a great admiration for his fellow
watch-officer.</p>

<p>“Thank you for that. Upon my sowl, I think you
are a good fellow, if you are a lunatic on the letter.
Take the advice of your best friend on board, and see
what’s in that envelope immejitly.”</p>

<p>“I will, since you advise it,” replied Tom, taking the
letter from his pocket.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>While O’Hara was glancing at the superscription, the
boatswain’s whistle sounded through the ship.</p>

<p>“All hands, up anchor!” shouted that officer, after
he had piped the call.</p>

<p>Tom Speers grasped the letter, and returned it to his
pocket. At the next instant he was at his station, for
with his lofty ambition he could not afford to be the
last in his place. The first lieutenant was in position
on the quarter-deck, with the speaking-trumpet in his
hand, though it was an emblem of authority, rather
than a useful implement in a quiet time.</p>

<p>“Man the capstan!” said this high official, in moderate
tones, considering the magnitude of the position
he filled.</p>

<p>The order was repeated by the other officers till it
came to the forecastle. Every seaman knew precisely
what he was to do in the operation of weighing the
anchor; and in a moment the bars were shipped and
swiftered. All hands were then in position, and waiting
for the next order.</p>

<p>“Heave around! Heave in the cable to a short
stay!” added the first lieutenant; and the order went
forward as before.</p>

<p>The first master had been directed to inform him
when the cable had the proper scope, which had been
indicated to him.</p>

<p>“Avast heaving!” said Tom Speers. “Cable at a
short stay, sir,” he added to the first lieutenant.</p>

<p>“Pawl the capstan! Unship the bars!” continued
the executive officer.</p>

<p>The cable was well stoppered, or secured where it
was. About three-fourths of the whole of the cable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
which had been run out was hauled in by the operations
described. The wind was moderate in the harbor,
and only enough was now out to hold the vessel
while the rest of the preparations were made for getting
under way. The part out was “up and down,” and a
few turns of the capstan would have lifted the anchor
clear of the bottom.</p>

<p>The length of cable used in anchoring, or in holding
the vessel at a short stay, requires the exercise of discretion
and judgment; but the young officers were
required to determine for themselves all these questions.
The harder it blows, or the swifter the tide, the
greater the scope of cable needed. It is true, the adult
boatswain was always on hand to see that the work
was properly done on the forecastle; and the vice-principal,
who was the only adult seaman in the cabin,
closely observed the manœuvres made; but they never
interfered, unless the safety of the vessel required them
to do so. If the young officers were at fault, they
were criticised afterwards, when the crew were not
present.</p>

<p>“Stations for loosing sail!” said the first lieutenant,
when the cable was at a short stay.</p>

<p>The fore-topsail was shaken out, the foresail and
mainsail were set; and the order was given to man
the jib and flying-jib halyards, and to ship the capstan
bars again.</p>

<p>“Anchor a-weigh, sir!” reported the first master on
the forecastle.</p>

<p>Tom Speers saw that the anchor was clear of the
bottom when the hands at the capstan had heaved a
few turns.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>“Let go the downhauls, and hoist away!” added
the executive officer; and at the order up went the jib
and flying-jib.</p>

<p>The wind was about north, and the sails were
trimmed as they filled. As soon as the Tritonia was
fairly under way, her fore-topmast-staysail, fore-top-gallant-sail,
and main-gaff-topsail were set. At the
same time the order was given to cat and fish the anchor,
or hoist it up to the cat-head, and then put it in
its usual position when the vessel was at sea.</p>

<p>As the beautiful craft swung around, and the breeze
filled her sails, ringing cheers came from the shore and
from the men-of-war in the harbor; all of which were
returned with vigor by the young tars. With the wind
on the beam, the two schooners stood out of the bay,
and in a short time were passing through the Strait of
Gibraltar. As they went out into the broad ocean, the
wind freshened till they were making ten knots an
hour. It was study time for the port-watch, and Tom
had no chance yet to read his letter.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III.<br>

<small>AN APPROACHING SQUALL.</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE port-watch were on duty from twelve till four
in the afternoon; but the second part had their
off time for the first two hours. The Tritonia was
jumping at a lively pace in the white-capped sea, headed
west, a quarter south. O’Hara had been impatiently
waiting for this time to come to dive into the mysteries
of that London letter. He was more anxious to know
the contents of the envelope than Tom was.</p>

<p>As soon as the starboard watch had piped to dinner,
the fourth lieutenant led the way to a place on the lee side
of the quarter-deck where they could be alone.
Tom produced the important letter, and broke the seal.
As he had surmised, it contained two other letters, one
of them addressed to Mr. Lowington, the principal of
the squadron, and the other in the handwriting of his
maternal uncle.</p>

<p>“Sure, you can’t deliver that one to Mr. Lowington
now,” said O’Hara, looking back to the distant land
which would soon be out of sight.</p>

<p>“I am not anxious to deliver it; for I can guess the
substance of what it contains,” replied Tom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>“Well, what’s in the letter from London?” asked
the lieutenant impatiently.</p>

<p>Tom Speers unfolded the sheet. It was a brief business-like
document, hardly covering a page of the paper,
though written in a very open hand. It was dated on
board steam-yacht Marian, at Southampton, though it
had been mailed in London.</p>

<p>Thomas Speers, the millionnaire uncle of the first
master, had died six weeks before. He had given about
half of his immense fortune to charitable institutions,
and the other half to his nephew. Judge Rodwood
was appointed guardian and trustee, so far as this
property was concerned. The judge had come to
England in his steam-yacht in order that he might
follow the academy squadron, if, as he feared, it had
left Europe on its return voyage to America.</p>

<p>“Give me your hand, Speers!” said O’Hara with
enthusiasm. “I was dead sure your uncle had made a
<i>millionnaire</i> of you!”</p>

<p>“I was rather afraid he had,” replied Tom moodily,
as he glanced at the letter again. “He gives me no
particulars of the death of my uncle, or in relation to
the fortune.”</p>

<p>“Upon my sowl, you are the quarist mortal that iver
came into the world, or will iver go out of it after getting
quare in it. You are afraid your uncle has made
a millionnaire of you! Where is your gratitude?”</p>

<p>“I don’t carry it in my trousers-pocket. The whole
of it is, O’Hara, I am too much interested in the voyage
of the Tritonia to care much about the contents of this
letter. I have just become an officer, and I don’t want
to give up my position.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>“I understand that; but what’s the use of running
away from the fortune that is waiting for you?”</p>

<p>“I don’t intend to run away from it. I think it will
keep till the Tritonia returns to the United States.”</p>

<p>“Another of those letters is addressed to you. Will
you leave that till to-morrow before you open it?”</p>

<p>“Not at all. This one is from my uncle, Perry Bowman;
and I am always glad to hear from him,” replied
Tom, as he opened the letter. “‘Wonderful news for you,
my dear boy,’” continued the first master, reading from
the letter: “‘your uncle is dead, and has left you at least
three millions of dollars: so much for bearing his name,
for he wanted to preserve it after he was gone. You
are to have the income of your money till you are
twenty-five, and then a million every five years till you
get the whole of it into your own hands. I have
resigned my guardianship of you in favor of Judge Rodwood.
I offered to pay over to him about four thousand
dollars in my hands; but he declined to take it till you
had formally named him as your guardian, as you have
the right to do, so far as personal care is concerned.
He advised me to pay over the money to you at once;
and I send you a letter of credit for the amount. You
may want it more before you get home than afterwards.’”</p>

<p>“Howly St. Patrick!” exclaimed O’Hara, as Tom
opened the valuable document alluded to. “You are
measly with money.”</p>

<p>“That paper will be convenient, wherever I happen
to be,” said Tom, with a smile, as he put the letter of
credit into his pocket-book. “I could have made a
better use of it six months ago than I can now. I was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
poor as a church-mouse then, when most of the fellows
were made of money.”</p>

<p>“You can buy them all out now,” added O’Hara.
“Now, what are you going to do about this business,
my lad?”</p>

<p>“I can’t do any thing now: it is too late for me to
go to London,” replied Tom with a smile.</p>

<p>“I see you are satisfied with the matter as it is.”</p>

<p>“I am.”</p>

<p>“But Judge Rodwood is over here in his steam-yacht
for the purpose of following the squadron, if he don’t
find it in European waters,” added the lieutenant.</p>

<p>“I am willing he should follow it.”</p>

<p>“When he begins to look into the matter, anybody
in Gibraltar can tell him the fleet has gone to Madeira;
and all he has to do is to follow you.”</p>

<p>“I don’t object.”</p>

<p>“Of course you don’t; but when he finds you, he
will take you out of the vessel.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe he will, if I am not ready to leave
her. Don’t my uncle Perry say I have the right to
name my own guardian? if the judge don’t do the right
thing, I will not consent to name him as my guardian.
But when I tell him I prefer to stay in the Tritonia, if
he is a reasonable man, as I think he is, he will not
object.”</p>

<p>“But you are not doing the right thing yourself, my
boy,” protested O’Hara. “What kind of a way was it
to put a telegraphic despatch in your pocket, and not
open it? And what kind of a way was it to lave your
letter unopened till it was too late to do what you were
told by your guardian? Don’t your uncle Perry tell
you to come home as soon as ever you can?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>“He has resigned as my guardian; and the other
one has not been properly appointed,” said Tom, laughing
at his own ingenuity in devising an excuse.</p>

<p>“How do you know what’s in the letter to Mr. Lowington?”
demanded the lieutenant.</p>

<p>“I have no doubt it contains an order for my discharge
from the academy squadron,” replied Tom. “I
would deliver it, if the principal were only here; for I
have no right to keep his letters back, whatever I do
with my own.”</p>

<p>“I think you had better give the letter to the vice-principal.”</p>

<p>“I am willing to do that.”</p>

<p>“I am afraid the powers that be will blame you for
not opening the letter before we sailed,” continued
O’Hara.</p>

<p>“I am willing to bear the blame for what I have
done,” replied Tom; and, seeing the vice-principal
coming up from the cabin, he delivered the letter to
him as he reached the deck.</p>

<p>“Where did you get this?” asked Mr. Pelham, surprised
to see a sealed letter to the principal so soon
after leaving port.</p>

<p>“It was in a letter to me, which I did not open till
just now,” replied Tom.</p>

<p>“And why didn’t you open it before the ship sailed?”
demanded Mr. Pelham, quite as much astonished as
the fourth lieutenant had been.</p>

<p>“I didn’t care to open it, sir,” answered Tom, wondering
how he could get out of the scrape without telling
the whole truth.</p>

<p>“That is very strange.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>“I had some idea of what the letter contained,”
added Tom, with a smile.</p>

<p>“And that was the reason you didn’t open it?”</p>

<p>“I was not interested in it.”</p>

<p>“There seems to be something under all this,
Speers,” continued the vice-principal, looking into the
honest face of the young man. “What is it?”</p>

<p>“A telegraph despatch, sir,” replied Tom, handing
the document to Mr. Pelham.</p>

<p>Tom found, after due consideration, that there was
no way out of the scrape; and he explained the whole
matter in full.</p>

<p>“I don’t care to have my shipmates know about this,
sir,” said Tom, when he had told the whole story.</p>

<p>“It is your private affair, and you have a right to
keep it to yourself if you choose,” replied Mr. Pelham;
“and I shall respect your wishes.”</p>

<p>“I have told O’Hara about it, but no one else.”</p>

<p>“But it cannot be long concealed that we have a millionnaire
on board,” added the vice-principal, laughing.
“Judge Rodwood will follow the squadron to Madeira.”</p>

<p>“When I see him I hope he will permit me to remain
in the Tritonia; and till that time I don’t care to
have any thing said.”</p>

<p>“Very well. But I think you ought to have opened
your letter before the vessel sailed. It was hardly
treating Judge Rodwood with proper respect, to take no
notice of his telegraphic despatch.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps it was not, sir; but I did not know what
to do. I suppose the whole of it is, that I didn’t want
to leave the vessel; and I was afraid if I answered the
despatch, or opened the letters, I might have to go,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
pleaded Tom honestly. “I have no doubt that letter
to Mr. Lowington contains a request for my discharge.”</p>

<p>“Probably it does; but I don’t see that any thing
can be done about it now. The vessel is almost out of
sight of land,” said Mr. Pelham, smiling; and he looked
as though he rather sympathized with the first master in
the trials and tribulations cast upon him by his coming
fortune. “I will consult with Mr. Fluxion, who is my
senior in rank, as soon as possible; though the sea is
rather too heavy just now to communicate with the
Josephine, except in a case of emergency.”</p>

<p>“I am in no hurry to have any thing done,” replied
Tom, laughing and shrugging his shoulders.</p>

<p>“The last log gave us ten knots, and the wind is
increasing. At this rate we may get to Madeira before
the American Prince overhauls us,” added the vice-principal.</p>

<p>“I am willing,” chuckled Tom.</p>

<p>Mr. Pelham descended to the steerage to resume his
duties as instructor in navigation. Tom was very well
satisfied with the result of his interview, and joined
O’Hara on the lee side of the vessel. His position was
safe, for the present at least; and he hoped Judge Rodwood
would be reasonable enough to allow him to complete
his course in the academy squadron.</p>

<p>“Well, my boy, did you get a black eye from the
vice?” asked O’Hara, who had been watching the
conference with the most intense interest.</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it: Mr. Pelham knows how it is himself,
and he behaved very handsomely,” replied Tom
cheerfully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>“I suppose the news will be all over the ship now
before the dog-watches are out,” added O’Hara.</p>

<p>“Three of us have the secret now; and I think we
are strong enough to keep it.”</p>

<p>“Then it can’t be kept.”</p>

<p>“If you keep a stopper on your jaw-tackle, O’Hara,
it will be safe till Judge Rodwood arrives at Madeira,
though I am not without a hope that we shall be gone
when he comes.”</p>

<p>“That is your little game, is it?”</p>

<p>“There is no game about it. It is only a hope I
have; and I shall do nothing wrong about it.”</p>

<p>“Of course you won’t do any thing wrong: you are
not the fellow for that,” added O’Hara, with a little
taste of Irish blarney.</p>

<p>“I am not so high-toned as Raymond; but, if I intend
to be captain of this vessel, of course I can’t afford to
be on the wrong side of any question; for it is a
matter of marks as well as of morality,” replied Tom,
with a laugh.</p>

<p>The matter was settled, for the present at least, so
far as the student was concerned. But the vice-principal
was not quite satisfied with the situation. The
letter to Mr. Lowington ought to have been delivered
before the vessel left Gibraltar. It might contain
something more than an application for the discharge
of the first master. He was very anxious to consult
with the senior vice-principal; and, as soon as the recitation
he had in hand was finished, he went on deck to
take a look at the weather.</p>

<p>The quarter-watch had been changed, and O’Hara
and Tom Speers were in charge of the deck. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
had no opportunity to converse together now, for it
was contrary to the rule for officers on duty to do any
unnecessary talking. But they noticed the nervous
manner of the vice-principal as he looked up to windward.
The wind had been increasing since the Tritonia
sailed in the forenoon. Though it still looked
squally and threatening, as it had for the last three
hours, there seemed to be a brief lull in the force of
the wind, though the barometer was falling.</p>

<p>The Josephine was abreast of the Tritonia; for the
two vessels were very equally matched, though each had
its peculiar advantage in different points. The former
could hug the wind a little closer, and the latter could
gain a trifle on the other going free. Each ship’s
company bragged of its own craft, because each
had got a little ahead of the other on its best
course.</p>

<p>“Signal on the Josephine, sir,” reported the lookout
on the weather cat-head.</p>

<p>“Signal on the Josephine, Mr. O’Hara,” repeated
the first master in the waist.</p>

<p>“Call the signal-officer,” added the fourth lieutenant.</p>

<p>The box containing the signals was opened; glasses
were in demand; and the signal which the Josephine
displayed was promptly examined.</p>

<p>“Do you make it out, Mr. Lingall?” asked O’Hara,
rather impatiently, for it was an unusual thing for one
vessel of the squadron to communicate with another
under like circumstances.</p>

<p>“‘Have you any’”—replied Lingall, who was the
signal-officer, and who had carefully studied his duties<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
since his unexpected promotion. “Reply that the
signal is understood, quartermaster.”</p>

<p>The proper flag was set, whereupon the Josephine
began to display single letters, indicating that the
article for which she desired to ask was not contained
in the signal code. The process was slow, but it was
sure in the end.</p>

<p>“How far have you got?” asked O’Hara.</p>

<p>“C-h-l-o,” replied Lingall.</p>

<p>“By the powers, you have made a mistake, Mr. Lingall!”
said the fourth lieutenant, with a laugh.</p>

<p>“I think not, sir: I take down each letter as it
comes,” replied Lingall.</p>

<p>“You have misplaced the letters: it is c-h-o-l they
mean; and they want to ask if we have the c-h-o-l-i-c,
colic.”</p>

<p>“I think not, sir; for I don’t believe that is the
way they spell ‘colic’ on board of the Josephine,”
added Lingall, with a smile, and not quite sure that it
was prudent to expose the blunder of his superior.</p>

<p>“Faix, you have me there! I see you have learned
your spelling-lesson well, Mr. Lingall.”</p>

<p>“‘R,’” continued the signal-officer, adding another
letter to the unfinished word.</p>

<p>“Chlor,” said O’Hara. “That’s not a nautical
word, to be sure.”</p>

<p>“No: it looks more like a medical term,” added Mr.
Pelham, who had joined the group gathered around the
signal-officer.</p>

<p>“‘O,’” continued Lingall, as another letter was indicated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>“Chloro: that must be chloroform. The professors
on board are going to perform a surgical operation.”</p>

<p>“I think not: there is no doctor on board of the
Josephine,” added Mr. Pelham.</p>

<p>“It must be some doctor’s stuff,” persisted the fourth
lieutenant.</p>

<p>“If you are patient for a few moments longer, you
will not be under the necessity of guessing what is
wanted. I am satisfied the word is chlorodyne,” said
the vice-principal.</p>

<p>“Chlorodyne!” exclaimed O’Hara. “Is that a
rope, or something to eat?”</p>

<p>“Neither: it is a medicine with which all the vessels
of the squadron are provided; and I have had
occasion to administer it several times.”</p>

<p>“If it’s physic I’ve nothing to say; but if there is a
rope in the ship that I don’t know, I feel guilty,” said
O’Hara, with a mock sigh of relief.</p>

<p>“‘D,’” continued Lingall, taking down the next
letter of the word.</p>

<p>“That’s enough,” interposed Mr. Pelham. “The
article wanted is chlorodyne; reply ‘understood,’—yes.”</p>

<p>This signal was transmitted, for the Tritonia had an
abundant supply of the medicine named; and Mr.
Pelham wondered how the Josephine happened to be
out of the article, since it was Dr. Winstock’s favorite
remedy in all cases of colic or severe pain in the
bowels.</p>

<p>“Heave to, and wait for a boat,” was the next message
interpreted from the signals.</p>

<p>The signal was duly reported to the captain, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
was studying his lessons in the cabin. He directed the
officer of the deck to obey the order, which was regarded
as coming from the senior vice-principal. Simultaneously
the two vessels came up into the wind, backing
their fore-topsails.</p>

<p>Mr. Pelham went down into the cabin as soon as
the Tritonia was brought to; but he returned in a few
moments, wearing his pea-jacket.</p>

<p>“This will afford me an opportunity to consult with
the senior vice-principal in regard to your matter,
Speers,” said Mr. Pelham to the first master in the
waist.</p>

<p>“I hope we shall not be ordered back,” replied Tom,
not a little annoyed at the prospect.</p>

<p>“I think there is no danger of that, Speers; but I
feel obliged to make the case known to Mr. Fluxion:
he will at least share the responsibility with me,”
replied Mr. Pelham.</p>

<p>Tom felt easier after this assurance. The vessel
pitched very heavily in the sea when she was hove to;
and, if the junior vice-principal had any doubt about
the propriety of leaving the Tritonia at such a time,
he did not express it to any one on board. Certainly
the indications of the weather, as gathered from the
barometer and the appearance of the heavens, were
any thing but favorable.</p>

<p>The second cutter of the Josephine was hoisted out
with its crew on board. The fact that the adult boatswain
was sent in the boat, in addition to the usual
crew, seemed to indicate that Mr. Fluxion would not
send the boat unless he considered the occasion an
emergency. It was probable that one of the students<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
in the vessel was very sick, and that Mr. Fluxion
believed the weather was better now than it was likely
to be for some hours to come.</p>

<p>The cutter from the Josephine cast off from the
schooner. The young oarsmen gave way with a will,
and the boat began to rise and to plunge into the
heavy sea. The two vessels were not more than a
couple of cable-lengths apart; but the passage from
one to the other occupied a considerable time.</p>

<p>The officer of the cutter skilfully brought his boat
under the lee of the Tritonia. It was a perilous position,
and it was in great danger of being dashed to
pieces against the counter of the vessel. A rope was
thrown to the bowman, who promptly secured it, and
made it fast by catching a turn over the fore-thwart.</p>

<p>The first master of the Josephine, who was in charge
of the cutter, was a lithe little fellow; and, taking to
the rope as a cat runs up a tree, he climbed to the deck
of the Tritonia in the twinkling of an eye.</p>

<p>“That was well done, Mr. Pepper,” said Mr. Pelham
when the little officer stood before him, drenched to
the skin by the seas that had broken over him. “You
want chlorodyne.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir: we had a large bottle of it, but the steward
dropped it on the floor of the steerage, and spilled
the whole of it,” replied Mr. Pepper. “Boyle is very
sick with colic, or something of that sort; and Mr.
Fluxion has no proper medicine for him.”</p>

<p>“I shall go on board of the Josephine with you;
and I have the bottle in my pocket,” added the junior
vice-principal, as he slid down the rope into the Josephine’s
cutter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>Mr. Pepper followed him, and the boat pulled back.
As it was evident that she must return to the Tritonia,
she was brought up under the counter of the Josephine.
Mr. Pelham was the first to board the vessel.</p>

<p>“I am surprised that you should leave your charge,
Pelham,” said the senior vice-principal anxiously, and
in a low tone, as his junior presented himself on the
deck.</p>

<p>It took Mr. Pelham five minutes to tell the story of
Tom Speers as briefly as it could be told.</p>

<p>“Never mind Speers or his letters,” said Mr. Fluxion
impatiently. “Return to the Tritonia at once!”</p>

<p>It was too late. A fearful squall was driving down
upon the two vessels.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV.<br>

<small>A VESSEL IN DISTRESS.</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">MR. PELHAM saw that he had made a mistake
in leaving the Tritonia at such a time, though he
would not have thought of doing so if the senior vice-principal
had not sent the boat. But it was a case of
severe sickness which had induced his superior to send
out a boat in such a sea. The squall, which might
prove to be a hurricane, was already roaring in the
distance. In a moment more it would break upon
the vessels.</p>

<p>“Get your boat in quick!” said Mr. Fluxion to the
officer of the deck, in sharp tones, though not loud
enough to be heard by the seamen. “Call all hands!”</p>

<p>At the same moment the senior vice-principal seized
the speaking-trumpet in the hands of the officer of the
deck, and, leaping into the main rigging, shouted,—</p>

<p>“Fill away! fill away!”</p>

<p>Whether, in the roar of the tempest, the officer in
charge of the Tritonia heard him or not, the vessel
immediately filled away. O’Hara was too good a sailor
to be caught napping at such a time. He had sent for
the captain as soon as he saw the squall coming; and,
as this was a case of emergency in which the officer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
of the deck was authorized to act without waiting for
orders, he had braced up the fore-yards on his own
responsibility.</p>

<p>Capt. Wainwright came on deck before the schooner
was fairly under way again. All hands were called, the
lessons of the professors in the steerage were promptly
abandoned, and almost in the twinkling of an eye the
canvas was reduced to a storm staysail.</p>

<p>The Josephine had a bigger problem to solve: the
officer of the deck sent for Capt. Vroome, but, without
waiting for his coming, ordered the cutter to be hauled
under the lee of the schooner; and it was hoisted up
at the davits, carefully secured, and swung inboard.</p>

<p>As soon as the boat was clear of the water, the forebraces
were manned, and the yards trimmed, the vessel
filling away as this was done. The orders came very
rapidly from the first lieutenant for a moment; but
they were executed as fast as they were given, and the
vessel was soon under the same short canvas as the
Tritonia.</p>

<p>The squall came down upon the little squadron, and
the vessels reeled under it. But this was one of the
emergencies which the students, especially the officers,
of the academy squadron, had been faithfully trained to
meet. The ships’ companies had executed the manœuvre
just completed, hundreds of times, in still water
and at sea in a fresh breeze.</p>

<p>Though the fury of the squall lasted but a short time,
it was succeeded by a severe gale, which had been sufficiently
prognosticated by the barometer and the aspect
of the heavens. When the first fierceness of the tempest
had somewhat abated, the Josephine set her foresail,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
close-reefed, and hoisted her jib. The wind still
came from the north-west, and she resumed her course
for the Madeira Islands.</p>

<p>Capt. Wainwright followed the example of his senior;
and the two vessels were again standing on their
course, which was still west, a quarter south. All went
well till dark, though the vessels labored heavily in the
ugly sea. The captain of the Tritonia was somewhat
anxious about his craft, as he had no vice-principal on
board upon whom he could lean if the situation became
more trying. He walked the deck, keeping his gaze
fixed to windward most of the time.</p>

<p>Since the squall a full watch had been kept on duty.
Scott was in charge of the deck when the darkness,
deep and dense, settled down upon the scene. Even
with only the jib and the double-reefed foresail, the
Tritonia rolled till the water frequently came in over
her high bulwarks, while the seas broke in heavy sheets
over the top-gallant forecastle.</p>

<p>“This will be a nasty night, Scott,” said the captain,
pausing in his walk on the weather side of the vessel.</p>

<p>“I never saw any thing worse,” replied the second
lieutenant. “But I think we shall be able to keep
most of the water on the outside of her.”</p>

<p>“She is wetter on deck than I ever saw her before,”
added Capt. Wainwright.</p>

<p>“Or behind either.”</p>

<p>“I am afraid we shall lose sight of the Josephine
before morning.”</p>

<p>“If we do, I suppose, like any other old wine-bibbers,
we can find our way to Madeira.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>“But I am very sorry that Mr. Pelham was unable
to return,” continued the captain.</p>

<p>“I think he will feel worse about it than any one
else,” answered Scott.</p>

<p>“It is for his sake that I am sorry.”</p>

<p>“I don’t object to a cruise on our own account as
long as we keep within the strict line of duty.”</p>

<p>“I am not alarmed, though in such a night as this I
cannot help feeling a little anxious about the vessel,”
said Capt. Wainwright. “I had no idea that we should
have such a storm as this proves to be. I don’t see
the lights of the Josephine.”</p>

<p>“I saw her starboard light within five minutes,”
added Scott, as he peered through the gloom of the
night in the direction the consort had last been seen.
“She can’t be far from us.”</p>

<p>“I see it now,” added the captain. “The tops of
the waves shut it out from our view at times.”</p>

<p>“Now we have lost it again.”</p>

<p>The Tritonia rolled and pitched fearfully, and of
course the Josephine was doing the same. The night
was a long and dismal one. Twice it became necessary
to call all hands to lay the vessel to under the storm
staysail. Even the jib and reefed foresail were too
much for her.</p>

<p>Shortly after the captain and second lieutenant were
observing the lights of the Josephine, they disappeared,
and were not seen again. A very heavy rain began to
pour down, and it was thought that the thickness of the
weather alone prevented them from seeing her. Capt.
Wainwright declared that it was the worst night he had
seen since he had been in the Tritonia; and Mr. Marline
confirmed his view of the matter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>The morning broke dull and heavy, with a fierce
rain-storm still battering against the rigging. The captain
had been on deck about all night, and had turned
in at eight bells in the morning when the watch was
changed, leaving the first lieutenant in charge of the
deck.</p>

<p>“Heard a gun off the port bow,” reported the lookout
on the top-gallant forecastle.</p>

<p>“Are you sure it was a gun?” asked Richards, the
fourth master, to whom the report was made.</p>

<p>“It was a good way off; but I’m pretty sure it was a
gun,” replied the seaman. “There it is again! I am
sure of it now.”</p>

<p>Richards heard the gun himself this time, though it
was only a dull report, evidently coming from a great
distance. He reported it to the officer of the deck.</p>

<p>“I haven’t heard it,” said Greenwood.</p>

<p>“You can hardly make out the sound above the roar
and swash of the sea. I heard it myself just now,”
added Richards.</p>

<p>They listened attentively for some minutes, but without
hearing the gun again. The first lieutenant concluded
that the officer and seaman had been mistaken,
and he sent the fourth master back to his station. All
hands forward listened again for some time; but the
gun was not heard.</p>

<p>“I was sure I heard it,” said Richards to the second
master.</p>

<p>“There are so many strange sounds in a storm like
this, that you can’t be sure of any thing,” replied Raymond.
“I hope you didn’t hear a gun, for it can only
be a signal of distress in such a storm.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>But Richards was piqued at the idea of having
made a false report, and he kept his ears wide open
for the next hour. Once he thought he heard the
sound again, but he did not mention it, though the
lookout glanced at him to indicate that he had heard
something.</p>

<p>It was too thick and dark to see any thing, even if
there had been a sinking ship within a cable’s length
of the Tritonia. Nearly half an hour later he heard
the sound again. It was a sort of dull and indistinct
“thud,” which might have been made by a wave under
the counter of the schooner; but it came from a distance,
and from the same direction as before.</p>

<p>“Gun on the weather-bow, sir,” repeated the lookout;
and this time he spoke so confidently that the
fourth master deemed it his duty to report again to the
officer of the deck.</p>

<p>“I imagined I heard it myself this time,” replied
Greenwood, looking very anxious. “But it might have
been a gun, and it might not.”</p>

<p>“I think it was a gun; and I have heard it several
times,” answered Richards.</p>

<p>“I don’t like to call the captain, after he has been
on deck all night, for nothing,” continued the first lieutenant,
looking very much troubled, as he wiped the
spray from his face.</p>

<p>“If it is a gun, it can only mean that some vessel is
in distress,” added Richards. “I think we had better
err on the side of humanity.”</p>

<p>“No doubt of it; but we are not running away from
the direction you report the sound as coming from.”</p>

<p>“If the vessel is disabled, she is drifting this way;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
and we can hardly work to windward in this weather.”</p>

<p>“Remain on the quarter-deck, if you please, Mr.
Richards, and see if you can make out the gun again,”
continued Greenwood.</p>

<p>“I hardly expect to hear it again for half an hour;
for it is that time since I heard it last,” said Richards,
as he climbed into the weather main rigging.</p>

<p>Greenwood continued to walk the deck along the
life-line, which had been extended fore and aft for the
safety of the officers and seamen on duty. As the
fourth master had suggested, the sound was not heard
again till nearly another half-hour had elapsed. Then
it was heard, and so distinctly that Richards thought
there could be no mistake about it this time.</p>

<p>“I heard it myself,” said the officer of the deck
when the report was made to him. “I will thank you
to call the captain, and inform him that signal-guns
have been heard on the weather-bow.”</p>

<p>Richards came down from his perch in the weather
rigging, and went below. Wainwright awoke from a
heavy slumber at the knock on his door; but he was
himself at once, and inquired carefully into the matter
of the report till he had satisfied himself that guns had
really been heard. Hastily putting on his pea-jacket,
he went on deck.</p>

<p>All hands gazed earnestly at him as he appeared,
and watched his movements with intense interest.
The vice-principal was not on board, and Capt. Wainwright
was the supreme authority. Mr. Primback, the
senior professor, who was nominally the head of the
institution in the absence of the vice-principal, knew<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
no more about a ship, or about nautical matters, than
a man that had never seen the ocean. The adult boatswain
and carpenter were seamen, and were competent
advisers; but they were without authority in the absence
of Mr. Pelham.</p>

<p>While Capt. Wainwright was inquiring into the situation,
the signal-gun was repeated; and this time it
could be plainly heard by all on deck. It was more
nearly on the beam than before. The Tritonia was
on her course. The wind, which had been rather variable
during the night, was now from the north, veering
to the west. The vessel in distress was therefore
almost dead to windward.</p>

<p>“Brace her sharp up, Mr. Greenwood,” said the captain,
as soon as he had fully taken in the situation.</p>

<p>The first lieutenant gave the necessary orders in
detail to carry out the command of the captain. The
Tritonia promptly answered her helm, and, coming
up into the wind, rose upon the tremendous sea, and
then darted down into the trough, while the crest of
the wave broke upon her top-gallant forecastle.</p>

<p>“We can’t make much beating to windward under a
double-reefed foresail, in such a sea as this,” said
Greenwood.</p>

<p>“I am afraid not,” replied the captain, as he returned
to the cabin to inform the senior professor of
the action he had taken.</p>

<p>“How do you know it is a ship in distress?” asked
Mr. Primback, greatly disturbed by the announcement.</p>

<p>“Ships at sea don’t fire guns for nothing in such a
sea as this,” answered Wainwright.</p>

<p>“It may be an engagement between a French and a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
German vessel; for France and Germany are unhappily
at war with each other at this time,” suggested the
professor.</p>

<p>“I think not, sir; for vessels in action would be
likely to fire oftener than once in half an hour,” replied
the captain.</p>

<p>“Very true: I think they would be likely to discharge
their guns more frequently than this,” added
Mr. Primback, looking wise. “You feel confident that
the guns are from a ship in distress?”</p>

<p>“I feel reasonably sure of it, sir.”</p>

<p>“Then I suppose it is quite proper to go to her assistance,”
said the professor, with an inquiring look at
the young commander.</p>

<p>“Entirely proper, Mr. Primback.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry that some other vessel does not have
this duty imposed upon it. Nevertheless, as the sea
is very stormy, and the violence of the motion does not
permit the conducting of the regular recitations, I dare
say that no great loss of time will result from this deviation
from the true course of the vessel.”</p>

<p>“I should say not, sir,” added the captain.</p>

<p>“Have you consulted with Mr. Marline, in the unfortunate
absence at this time of Mr. Pelham?”</p>

<p>“I have not done so, sir. Mr. Marline turned in,
and”—</p>

<p>“Did what? Do me the favor to speak the English
language when you address me,” interposed the professor,
who could not tolerate even the mildest of nautical
terms.</p>

<p>“He went to bed, sir.”</p>

<p>“Ah, he retired?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>“Yes, sir: he turned in when”—</p>

<p>“Retired, if you please.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir: he retired from the deck when I did; and
I have not seen him since the signal-guns were reported
to me.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Marline is a prudent mariner; and I request
that you confer with him before any decided steps are
taken.”</p>

<p>“But I have taken the decided step already; for I
have hauled her up”—</p>

<p>“How can that be when the vessel is far out of sight
of the land? You speak in enigmas,” interrupted Mr.
Primback.</p>

<p>“We braced her up”—</p>

<p>“In English, sir,” said the professor rather sternly.</p>

<p>“I don’t know that I can describe nautical manœuvres
in any other than nautical language,” said Wainwright.
“We were going with the wind free before,
sir”—</p>

<p>“The wind is always free, Wainwright: no one can
control it.”</p>

<p>“Well, sir, I caused the schooner to be turned so
that she is headed as near as she can go in the direction
from which the wind comes.”</p>

<p>“That is quite intelligible. I thank you.”</p>

<p>“The vessel is now headed as near as can be towards
the ship in distress. If you wish me to speak
to Mr. Marline I will do so, sir; but I think it is better
to let him sleep, after being on deck as he was all
night.”</p>

<p>“He must be somewhat fatigued; and you may wait
till he gets up from his bed.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>Wainwright withdrew from the cabin of the professor,
and went on deck again. It was still too thick to make
out the vessel in distress; and, when he had directed
the first lieutenant to call him if occasion should require,
he went to his state-room to obtain the rest he
needed.</p>

<p>The guns were repeated every half-hour as before;
and it was evident that the two vessels were coming
nearer together. The rain had ceased, but a thick fog
had settled down upon the ocean, and concealed the
two craft from each other. But the captain could not
sleep, weary as he was, in his anxiety about the wreck
to windward of the Tritonia. He went on deck. The
gun sounded as though the vessel in distress was not
more than a mile distant.</p>

<p>There was no gun on board of the schooner, or he
would have used it to inform the sufferers that assistance
was at hand.</p>

<p>The Tritonia had tacked several times in the heavy
sea; and, after the captain came on deck the second
time, he had ordered the addition of a close-reefed
mainsail to the vessel, for the wind seemed to have
abated a trifle.</p>

<p>“I see her!” shouted the lookout forward.</p>

<p>“Where away?” demanded the fourth master, springing
upon the rail of the vessel, ready to get into the
fore-rigging.</p>

<p>“Sharp on the weather-bow.”</p>

<p>“I see her,” added Richards, as he made out the
dim outline of the craft in the fog, which had lifted a
little as if to reveal the presence of the sufferer.</p>

<p>“She is a steamer!” shouted Richards, as he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
jumped down upon the deck, and hurried aft as rapidly
as the uneasy motion of the Tritonia would permit.</p>

<p>He reported to the first lieutenant the position of the
steamer; and immediately all the officers leaped upon
the rail, and looked intently to windward to obtain a
view of her.</p>

<p>“What do you make of her, Mr. Greenwood?”
asked Capt. Wainwright, who was of course too dignified
to leave the quarter-deck.</p>

<p>“She is a steamer, barkentine rig. She is heeled
over to port, with her stern settled deep in the water,”
replied the first lieutenant.</p>

<p>“Down from the rail!” shouted the captain.</p>

<p>The order was repeated by the officer of the deck,
and the momentary panic caused by the appearance of
the wreck gave place to the usual order on board of the
schooner. The captain sent the fourth master to call
Marline; and this old salt was greatly surprised when
he learned what had been done while he slept.</p>

<p>“How do we happen to be headed to the nor’ard,
captain?” asked he, after he had glanced at the compass.</p>

<p>“We have been working to windward for the last four
hours in search of this vessel, for we heard her signal-guns
at two bells in the morning watch,” replied the
captain, with a smile at the blank look of astonishment
on the face of the boatswain. “Mr. Primback desired
me to confer with you as soon as you came on
deck.”</p>

<p>“Why was I not called before?”</p>

<p>“I thought it best not to disturb you after you had
been all night on deck.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>“And you were on deck all night also.”</p>

<p>“I was; but I was called at two bells. I propose
to lie to under the lee of the steamer, and send a boat
on board of her as soon as practicable,” continued the
captain. “What do you think of that idea?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think much of it,” replied the old sailor
bluntly. “Do you think of sending a boat on board
of the wreck at once?”</p>

<p>“Do you think it is safe to get out a boat?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think it is safe; and for that reason I
shouldn’t lay her to.”</p>

<p>“What would you do?” asked Capt. Wainwright,
rather nettled by the disapproval of the boatswain.</p>

<p>“I should run as near the wreck as possible, hail
them, and say we will stand by them; then stand off
and on till the weather moderates a little. A boat
might live now; but the steamer floats, and don’t
seem to be in any immediate danger of going down,”
said Mr. Marline, when he had examined the condition
of the wreck as well as he could in the fog.</p>

<p>“I like that plan,” replied the captain; “but I
thought we might be able to reach the wreck in a
boat.”</p>

<p>“If there was any need of it, we might,” added the
boatswain, now getting a better view of the steamer.
“She has a hole in her starboard bow; she has been
run into by another vessel. I think the water poured
into that hole in the beginning, flowed aft, and settled
her down by the stern so as to lift the opening out of
the water. That is what saved her. It was a miracle.”</p>

<p>The Tritonia tacked again, and then stood under the
stern of the wreck. Only one man, whose gray locks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
were streaming in the fresh wind, could be seen on
board of her.</p>

<p>“We will stand by you!” shouted Greenwood
through the trumpet, as the Tritonia passed within a
few fathoms of the steamer.</p>

<p>“Two ladies on board!” yelled the man in response
to the hail.</p>

<p>“We will save them!” replied Greenwood.</p>

<p>The Tritonia passed out of hailing distance.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V.<br>

<small>BOARDING THE WRECK.</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">“THERE seems to be but one man on board the
wreck,” said Wainwright, when the Tritonia
had passed out of hailing distance.</p>

<p>“And he says there are two women on board,” added
Marline. “It seems to me that I have heard that
man’s voice before.”</p>

<p>“He speaks plain English, at any rate,” continued
the captain. “Have you any idea what has become of
the Josephine, Mr. Marline?”</p>

<p>“It was easy enough to lose her in such a night as
the last. She may have carried sail while we were
laying to, or we may have carried sail while she was
doing so. She may have been within a few miles of
us when we changed our course to the nor’ard.”</p>

<p>“But, if she had been anywhere near us, she would
have heard the guns on this steamer,” suggested Wainwright.</p>

<p>“I think we shall have a change of weather soon,
and we shall find out where she is.”</p>

<p>“The barometer is rising; and I am confident, if
the Josephine’s people heard those guns, she will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
follow them up, and we shall see her in the course of
the forenoon.”</p>

<p>“No doubt of it,” replied Marline. “The fog is lifting
now.”</p>

<p>“The steamer seems to be in no danger of sinking,”
added Wainwright, as he brought his glass to bear upon
her. “Her stern is well down in the water, but her
bow is clear up in the air.”</p>

<p>“She won’t go down unless the weather gets worse.
It is moderating very rapidly.”</p>

<p>“What can we do with the steamer after we get on
board of her?” asked the captain, who had been considering
this question since the wreck was first discovered.</p>

<p>“I don’t know that we can do any thing but save the
passengers,” replied Marline.</p>

<p>“But the vessel seems to be in good condition; and
it may be possible to take her into port.”</p>

<p>“It may be; but I think we have not force enough to
handle her, if the crew have deserted her.”</p>

<p>“If we save her, won’t she belong to us?” inquired
Wainwright, who had been a seaman on the Josephine
when she picked up a Dutch vessel in the North Sea,
in a sinking condition.</p>

<p>“No; but the judges of the Marine Court, or whatever
they call it over here, decide what part of the
value of the vessel shall be given to those that save
her.”</p>

<p>“It is a case of salvage, then. I didn’t know but the
vessel, if she had been wholly abandoned, might go to
those who picked her up.”</p>

<p>“I am no sea-lawyer, and I don’t know much about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
it; but my notion is, that if the owners claim her, they
take her by paying the salvage decreed by the court.
I am sorry Mr. Pelham is not here to settle all the
questions that may come up concerning this steamer.”</p>

<p>“I think we shall be able to settle them somehow or
other,” replied Wainwright confidently. “It would be
a big thing for the Tritonia to send that vessel into
port.”</p>

<p>“So it would; but it will be a bigger thing to save
the passengers on board of her. Though we see but
one man on board of her, there may be a dozen or
twenty,” added Marline.</p>

<p>“What are they about, if there are any others in
her?”</p>

<p>“That’s more than I know; but men lose their heads
in times of trouble. The crew may have broken into
the rum-barrels, and got drunk. A crew is very likely
to do such a thing after the discipline of the vessel is
lost.”</p>

<p>“Do you suppose that is the case?”</p>

<p>“I don’t suppose any thing about it: I have known
just such things to happen,” answered Marline, who
evidently did not care to continue the conversation, for
he did not wish to commit himself to any thing.</p>

<p>The sea was still too heavy, when the port-watch came
on duty at eight o’clock, to allow any recitation to be
conducted in the steerage. Professor Primback, with
his supreme contempt for all things nautical, was unable
to keep on his legs, and was therefore incompetent
to sustain the dignity of his position. He knew
that the students would laugh if a smart sea should
upset him, or cause him to reel, during his demonstration<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
at the blackboard; and he was unwilling to tempt
them. For this reason it was usually vacation time in
very stormy weather. The seamen not on duty were
reclining in their berths, or wedged into various corners
where they could save themselves from being pitched
about by the savage plunging of the vessel. Every
movable thing had been secured by the stewards, for
neither tables nor stools would stay upon their legs.</p>

<p>Professor Primback was very nervous and uneasy in
the absence of the vice-principal; for he did not place
any great confidence in the good judgment and discretion
of the young officers of the vessel. He perversely
refused to inform himself in regard to seamanship and
maritime custom and law; and he was no better than a
child outside of the duties of an instructor. He remained
in his berth till after nine o’clock in the morning,
because he would not trust himself to the uneasy
deck. But he was not satisfied with the action of the
young commander, even after the latter had consulted
with Mr. Marline.</p>

<p>After he had carefully considered the situation without
being able to reach any conclusion, he decided to
go on deck,—if he could get there,—and examine for
himself into the condition of affairs. He got out of his
berth with no little difficulty, and by sundry darts and
plunges reached the companion-way. While he had the
baluster under his hand he did very well, and succeeded
in reaching the quarter-deck without any disaster.</p>

<p>Seeing Capt. Wainwright on the weather side, he
waited a moment till the vessel was on an even keel, and
then started for him. If he had known any thing about
the motions of a ship, or had understood the meaning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
of the order given, “Ready about,” as he appeared at
the companion-way, he would not have undertaken the
feat of crossing the deck at that particular moment.</p>

<p>“Hard down the helm!” shouted Scott, the second
lieutenant, who was then in charge of the deck.</p>

<p>The Tritonia threw her head up into the wind as the
hands at the wheel obeyed the order. As she fell off
she met a tremendous wave, which broke over the top-gallant
forecastle, and, as the bow of the vessel rose
upon the sea, sent tons of water rolling along the lee
side of the deck. The officers and seamen, as taught
to do by experience, seized the life-lines, and held on
for a moment till the water had poured out through the
scuppers. But Mr. Primback was either too ignorant
or too dignified to depend upon any support but his
legs, and was knocked from his feet, and carried over
to leeward. Mr. Marline and some others had warned
him in season of his danger; but unfortunately they
used sea-slang in doing so, and the professor did not
comprehend the warning.</p>

<p>The boatswain sprang to his assistance, and picked
him up. He conducted him to one of the life-lines,
where he was content to hold on. The foresail and
the mainsail went over, and as soon as they filled the
motion of the schooner was easier.</p>

<p>“What do you mean, sir?” demanded the professor
angrily, as Scott passed by him in the discharge of his
duty.</p>

<p>“I don’t mean any thing, sir,” replied the joker
demurely, and was about to continue on his way to the
waist.</p>

<p>“Stop, sir! What do you mean by playing a trick<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
upon me when I come on deck?” foamed the worthy
instructor.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, sir, if I have done any thing
wrong,” added Scott, shrugging his shoulders like a
Frenchman. “I did not mean to do any thing out of
the way.”</p>

<p>“You tipped the ship so as to throw me down,”
added the irate professor.</p>

<p>“I didn’t tip the ship, sir.”</p>

<p>“You gave the order to have it done, as soon as
you saw me come on deck.”</p>

<p>“The captain ordered me to tack ship, and I gave
the order to the watch on deck, sir. I only did what
the captain told me to do.”</p>

<p>“This isn’t the first time you have played such a
trick upon me,” continued Mr. Primback, who honestly
believed that Scott was the author of his misfortune.</p>

<p>The professor considered that any person who was
capable of making a joke would not scruple to do a
wicked deed; and for this reason Scott was not a
favorite with the professor.</p>

<p>“I never played a trick upon you in my life, sir,”
pleaded the second lieutenant, with his cheerful smile.</p>

<p>“Don’t contradict me, Scott!” said Mr. Primback,
waxing more indignant as he saw the smile. “I will
report you for discipline to the vice-principal as soon
as he returns.”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, Mr. Primback,” interposed the
captain, “but I do not think Mr. Scott was to blame.”</p>

<p>“I did not ask your opinion, Wainwright: I hold
<i>Mr.</i> Scott responsible for his own acts,” snapped the
professor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>“He only obeyed the order I gave him to tack ship,
and it was not his fault that she made a lee lurch.”</p>

<p>“You will use none of that gibberish to me! And I
will tolerate no interference when I speak to a student.”</p>

<p>“I only desired to explain, sir,” added the captain,
with the utmost deference and respect.</p>

<p>“Then do it in English.”</p>

<p>“When the vessel turned so that the wind did not
press upon the sails, the heavy waves caused her to
roll and pitch violently,” continued the captain.</p>

<p>“And Scott turned the vessel just as he saw me
come on deck.”</p>

<p>“I gave him the order to turn her.”</p>

<p>“He could have waited a moment till I had reached
a secure position. He has been guilty of disrespect to
the senior professor of the vessel.—Scott, you will go
down into the cabin, and settle this case with me,” continued
Mr. Primback, who was certainly more irritable
than usual.</p>

<p>Wainwright was confounded by this order. It was
plain that the professor had forgotten the regulation of
the principal, which ought to have governed him in
the present emergency. In the absence of the vice-principal,
he had no control whatever over the captain
in regard to the management of the vessel. He was
taking the course pursued by another professor in the
squadron, who had been sent home for interfering with
the discipline of the ship.</p>

<p>“Mr. Scott is the officer of the deck, sir,” said the
captain, greatly embarrassed by the situation.</p>

<p>“I don’t care if he is: he will obey my order, or I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
will suspend him from duty,” replied Mr. Primback
stoutly.</p>

<p>“You will excuse me, sir, if I call your attention to
the regulation bearing upon this case,” continued the
captain.</p>

<p>“Is my order to be obeyed, or not?” demanded the
professor.</p>

<p>“I hope you will revoke the order till you have
looked at the regulations, sir.”</p>

<p>“This is insolence, Wainwright. I am the acting
vice-principal of this vessel in the absence of Mr. Pelham.
I stand in his place; and he is authorized to
suspend an officer for cause.”</p>

<p>“If you will be kind enough to read the regulations,
I think you will see that you are mistaken,” added the
captain in a low tone.</p>

<p>“I am not mistaken,” persisted the professor.</p>

<p>“We shall have to tack again in a moment, Mr.
Primback; and the vessel will roll and pitch as badly
as before.”</p>

<p>“I think you had better go below, sir,” said Mr.
Marline, coming up to the professor at this moment,
hoping to make an end of the disagreeable controversy.
“The sea is very heavy, and she may roll herself full of
water up to the rail.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Marline, you will see that Scott obeys my order,”
replied Mr. Primback, creeping along the life-line
towards the companion-way.</p>

<p>The boatswain made no reply, but took the arm of
the “philosopher,” as he insisted upon calling all the
professors, and helped him down the steps. He deposited
him on a sofa where he could preserve his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
equilibrium. The learned gentleman was very glad to
be in a safe position again; but he could not forget the
fancied injury to which he had been subjected.</p>

<p>“I ordered Scott to come into the cabin, and settle
his case with me, Mr. Marline. He hasn’t come yet,”
said the professor, wiping the salt spray from his face.</p>

<p>“I beg your honor’s pardon, but you are all wrong
in this matter,” replied Marline bluntly, for he saw that
nothing but plain speech would answer his purpose.</p>

<p>At the same time he took from his pocket a copy of
the regulations which had been printed on board of the
Young America, and slowly unfolded the document.</p>

<p>“How can I be all wrong, when, in the absence of
the vice-principal, I am in his place, and my authority
is supreme?” asked the professor in great astonishment.</p>

<p>“Your honor is no sailor.”</p>

<p>“I thank the stars that I am not.”</p>

<p>“The regulations say that you cannot interfere with
the management of the vessel, or with the officers and
seamen in the discharge of their duty. If the vice-principal
is not on board, the professors can’t meddle
with the navigation of the ship. That’s the law; and
all we have to do is to obey it.”</p>

<p>Mr. Primback took the regulations, adjusted his
glasses, and proceeded to read the articles relating to
his own duties. The boatswain was right; but the professor
was unwilling to admit the fact.</p>

<p>“Am I placed at the mercy of these boys?” demanded
Mr. Primback, as he removed his glasses, and
looked at the boatswain.</p>

<p>“So far as handling the vessel is concerned, I don’t
see that you have any thing to do with them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>“They are my scholars, but they may insult me if
they choose.”</p>

<p>“But they don’t choose to do any thing of the kind.
It was no more Scott’s fault that you were rolled into
the scuppers, than it was mine; and I’m sure I had
nothing to do with it,” added Marline.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe it: the fellow laughed in my face
when I spoke to him. If he comes into the cabin, as I
directed him to do, and makes a suitable apology for
his conduct, I will pass over his offence as lightly as
possible.”</p>

<p>“Scott obeyed orders, and he couldn’t help himself.”</p>

<p>“He did not want to help himself,” persisted Mr.
Primback. “I will resign my position before I will
submit to such treatment.”</p>

<p>Just then the Tritonia tacked, and the vessel gave a
tremendous lurch, as if to illustrate the argument of
the boatswain. The professor was hurled from his
seat, and Marline helped him up.</p>

<p>“You don’t think that I did that, do you, Mr. Primback?”
asked the old salt.</p>

<p>“Of course you did not. Have you any control
over these boys, Mr. Marline?” inquired the professor
in a tone of contempt.</p>

<p>“None at all in the absence of the vice-principal,”
answered the boatswain.</p>

<p>“Then they may take us anywhere, and do what
they please with us, if I understand the situation.”</p>

<p>“I suppose so, sir.”</p>

<p>“Then I never comprehended my position before,”
added the professor, with increasing disgust.</p>

<p>“The trouble, if there is any, is all on account of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
the absence of the vice-principal, who is authority in all
matters.”</p>

<p>“I had trouble enough with these boys before he
came on board. I supposed in his absence that I took
his place.”</p>

<p>“But your honor is no sailor; and you couldn’t
handle the vessel if you tried.”</p>

<p>“I have no desire to handle the vessel; but, if these
boys can insult me with impunity, it is time for me to
know it.”</p>

<p>The conversation, which did not promise to end in
any happy result, was interrupted by the appearance of
third master Lingall, who politely touched his hat, and
stood waiting to deliver his message.</p>

<p>“What do you want?” demanded Mr. Primback.</p>

<p>“The captain desires to see Mr. Marline on deck,”
said Lingall.</p>

<p>“Tell the captain that Mr. Marline is engaged with
me,” interposed the professor testily.</p>

<p>“I will report to the captain myself,” added Marline,
who was in a better frame of mind than the “philosopher.”</p>

<p>“Wait till I have done with you.”</p>

<p>“I beg your honor’s pardon, but I always obey the
captain,” replied the boatswain; and touching his hat,
and scraping his right foot across the floor, he hastened
on deck.</p>

<p>“Stop!” called Mr. Primback. “I have something
more to say to you.”</p>

<p>“I will see your honor as soon as I can,” added the
boatswain; and he ran up the steps.</p>

<p>Mr. Marline could see that the professor was very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
unreasonable, considering there was a steamer in distress
depending upon the Tritonia for assistance. He
touched his hat to the captain, and waited for further
orders.</p>

<p>“What do you think of the sea now, Mr. Marline?”
asked Wainwright.</p>

<p>“It has improved a good deal during the last
hour.”</p>

<p>“Do you think it is prudent to get out a boat?”</p>

<p>“I think it is as good weather as we are likely to
have for some time,” replied Marline, looking at the
sky and the sea.</p>

<p>“Then we will board the steamer.”</p>

<p>The captain gave the order to call all hands; and, as
soon as the ship’s company had mustered, the vessel
was heaved to. The second cutter was cleared away,
and her crew piped into her. O’Hara was detailed to
take charge of her; and Mr. Rimmer, the carpenter, was
directed to go in the boat, not only to render any
assistance that might be required in boarding the
steamer, but to examine into her condition.</p>

<p>The cutter was lowered into the water, with the crew
in her, under the direction of Mr. Marline. It was no
easy task to accomplish this work in the heavy sea. The
boat rose and fell on the angry waves; but it was so
well managed that very little water was taken in. Under
the lee of the drifting steamer the water was comparatively
smooth. The man who had hailed the
Tritonia threw a line to the cutter, which Mr. Marline
secured to the fore-thwart.</p>

<p>“Are we to lower the ladies into the cutter?” asked
O’Hara, when the boat was fast to the steamer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>“I can’t say what’s to be done till we have boarded
her,” replied the boatswain.</p>

<p>“Then I’ll do that same at once,” added the fourth
lieutenant; and, suiting the action to the word, he ran
up the line like a cat.</p>

<p>“Well, good gracious! this is one of the academy
squadron!” said the man on board of the steamer, as
O’Hara leaped down from the rail. “I thought so the
minute I laid eyes on her; but, seeing her out here all
alone, I gave up the idea at once.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Frisbone!” exclaimed the lieutenant, as he
recognized the gentleman who had presented the American
Prince to the principal of the academy squadron.</p>

<p>“Well, you boys are smart sailors; and you are an
honor to your country,” added Mr. Frisbone.</p>

<p>“I thought you had given up going in any steamers,
after your experience in the American Prince.”</p>

<p>“We went to Liverpool to meet my wife’s sister, who
came over here for her health. The doctors said Malaga
was the place for her to spend the winter; and we
started for Spain. When I got into France, I found
the Germans had got almost over to the seashore; and
we took this steamer at Havre for Cadiz. Last night
she was run into by another vessel, and had a hole
knocked in her bow. We were the only passengers on
board; and the crew jumped on board of the other vessel
as soon as they found she had a hole in her.”</p>

<p>“But didn’t they try to save you and your wife?”
asked O’Hara indignantly.</p>

<p>“Yes, they did; but my wife and her sister were
both sick in their berths; and, when I got them out,
the crew had deserted her, and the other vessel was out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
of sight in the fog. The fact was, they were so flurried
they didn’t know what they were about.”</p>

<p>“We will take them on board of the Tritonia.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe we could ever get them into that
boat,” added Mr. Frisbone, as he glanced at the cutter,
which was almost swamped in every sea that swept by
her.</p>

<p>“The steamer don’t seem to be in any present danger
of going down,” said O’Hara.</p>

<p>“She won’t sink this time; and, if her crew had only
stuck by her, they might have saved her.”</p>

<p>“She is not very heavily loaded.”</p>

<p>“She has some machinery or something of that sort
in her; and it must have shifted so as to bring that
hole out of the water. If I had some help I could
right her.”</p>

<p>O’Hara asked Mr. Rimmer to come on board.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI.<br>

<small>A VOLUNTEER SHIP’S COMPANY.</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE carpenter of the Tritonia climbed up the
rope, and reached the deck of the steamer. The
moment he saw Mr. Frisbone, he recognized him, and
saluted him with nautical politeness.</p>

<p>“Mr. Rimmer, the carpenter of the Tritonia,” said
O’Hara, by way of introduction.</p>

<p>“I am glad to see an American seaman on board of
this steamer,” replied Mr. Frisbone heartily. “You
are the carpenter of the Tritonia, and you can soon
tell whether this vessel is worth saving.”</p>

<p>“She don’t seem to be in very bad condition with
the exception of that hole in her starboard bow,”
added Mr. Rimmer, as he cast his eyes about him.</p>

<p>“I wish you would look her over; and then we can
decide what is best to be done.”</p>

<p>The carpenter began his survey of the vessel, accompanied
by Mr. Frisbone and O’Hara. They visited
every part of her, examining very carefully into her
condition.</p>

<p>“I suppose I know as much about the engine as anybody;
and I can say that it is in good order,” said Mr.
Frisbone, as they passed the door of the engine-room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>“I don’t know any thing about engines,” added the
carpenter modestly. “But I can say that the vessel is
in first-rate condition; and that hole in her bow can be
stopped so that she will live in any sea. The opening
is above the water-line, so that there will be no great
pressure upon it.”</p>

<p>“Then we can save the vessel,” replied the American
Prince, as he claimed to be, and as he had named
his steam-yacht. “That will be a feather in the caps
of you boys.”</p>

<p>“I should like to take a hand in the game,” said
O’Hara, his face lighting up at the prospect.</p>

<p>“But we want help; and there is a great deal of
hard work to be done,” continued Mr. Frisbone. “How
many hands have you in your boat?”</p>

<p>“Ten besides Mr. Rimmer.”</p>

<p>“If they are good stout hands, we may do something
with them.”</p>

<p>“But I must report the condition of the vessel, and
wait for further orders,” interposed O’Hara.</p>

<p>“Quite right,” added the Prince, with a smile. “I
forgot that you live on your discipline.”</p>

<p>“But the boat came off to take you and the ladies
on board the Tritonia.”</p>

<p>“I think we are safe enough here for the present;
and I know the women-folks won’t think they can get
into that boat while it is bobbing around like corn in a
popper. Return to your ship, and give my respects to
the captain and the old folks on board, and tell them
I think the steamer can be saved.”</p>

<p>O’Hara tried to explain how easy it would be to get
the ladies into the cutter; but Mr. Frisbone seemed to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
be unwilling to leave the steamer while there was a
chance to save her. He conducted the young officer
into the cabin, the door of which opened from the
main deck.</p>

<p>“Here, Maggie,” said the Prince, calling to his wife,
who was in her state-room. “One of the vessels of
the academy squadron has come to get us out of this
scrape.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Frisbone came out of the state-room, looking
very pale and sick. She was followed by her sister the
invalid, who, however, looked better than the Prince’s
wife.</p>

<p>“This is Lieut. O’Hara, of the Tritonia; Mrs. Frisbone.”</p>

<p>The young officer took off his cap, and bowed
politely to the lady.</p>

<p>“Miss Louise Rodwood, my wife’s sister,” continued
the prince.</p>

<p>O’Hara thought she was a very pretty girl, and he
indulged in an extra flourish as he saluted her.</p>

<p>“With the compliments of the captain, I beg to
tender you the hospitalities of the Tritonia,” said the
lieutenant, when he had formally greeted the ladies.</p>

<p>“Good!” roared the American Prince. “That is
a very pretty way to address a couple of shipwrecked
women; and it is a credit to your bringing-up.”</p>

<p>“I beg to place our vessel at the disposal of the
ladies; and whatever else we may not be able to do for
you, we will keep the ship right side up.”</p>

<p>“That’s handsome; and the boat is all ready to take
you to the steamer, Maggie.”</p>

<p>“I would rather drown where I am than attempt to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
get into that boat,” protested Mrs. Frisbone. “I saw
it from the window in my room; and it jumps about
like a wild horse.”</p>

<p>“I am sure I can’t slide down a rope into the boat
as I saw that man come up,” added Miss Rodwood.</p>

<p>“All right; and we will stay where we are for the
present,” said Mr. Frisbone.</p>

<p>“We can rig a whip, and lower the ladies into the
cutter without any difficulty,” persisted the young officer,
who perhaps thought it would be pleasant to have
such a passenger as the younger lady.</p>

<p>“If we are in no danger here, as Mr. Frisbone says
we are not, I prefer to stay where I am,” replied Mrs.
Frisbone; and her sister was of the same mind.</p>

<p>“All right, lieutenant,” added the Prince. “I
thought the women would rather stay where they are;
and I think you had better return to your ship, and
report to the captain. If he will send as many men
as he can spare, I believe we can put this craft into
sailing-trim in a few hours.”</p>

<p>“I will do so, sir. But you forget that we have no
engineers on board of the Tritonia to run the engine,”
suggested O’Hara.</p>

<p>“I will run the engine myself. I never went to sea
much, but I have run an engine on a river and bay
steamer enough to understand the business,” replied
the American Prince. “If you will find firemen, I will
look out for the engine.”</p>

<p>“I will report all you say to the captain.”</p>

<p>“Let me see: you have a vice-principal, or something
of that sort, in each of the consorts. Of course
he will direct in this matter.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>“We have no vice-principal in the Tritonia just
now;” and O’Hara explained how they happened to
be without one.</p>

<p>“Then I suppose the professors attend to this business.”</p>

<p>“No, sir: the captain attends to it in the absence of
the vice-principal. The professors have nothing to do
with the management of the vessel, for they are not
sailors.”</p>

<p>“And I would rather trust the young gentlemen in
matters of seamanship than the professors,” added
Mr. Rimmer, with a chuckle.</p>

<p>O’Hara bowed to the ladies, and retired from the
cabin. He tried to be dignified and graceful; but
the heavy rolling of the steamer interfered sadly with
the poetry of motion. Both of the ladies were holding
on with all their might at the brass rods which extended
the entire length of the cabin on each side,
except across the doors of the state-rooms. Every
thing seemed to be in good order, and every article
was lashed so that it could not move at the motion
of the vessel.</p>

<p>O’Hara and Rimmer slid down into the boat, which
was protected from the full force of the sea by being
under the lee of the steamer. The cutters were all
life-boats, and when well handled would keep right
side up in any ordinary sea. The crews had been
thoroughly disciplined in the roughest weather in
which it was safe to launch a boat; so that they were
perfectly at home on the present occasion.</p>

<p>The second cutter pulled under the davits, and the
falls were hooked on. This feat was accomplished not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
without great difficulty, and only by watching for the
favorable moment. A blunder might have smashed
the boat, and thrown its crew into the sea. When the
falls were fast, the hands on deck hoisted the boat up
to the davits.</p>

<p>O’Hara reported to the captain, and explained why
the passengers on board the wreck had not come off in
the boat. Wainwright was not a little surprised to
learn that Mr. Frisbone, the munificent donor of the
American Prince, was on board of the steamer with his
wife. He knew precisely what Mr. Lowington would
do if he had been within hail, and precisely what he
would wish to have done in his absence.</p>

<p>“Mr. Frisbone desires you to send as many hands as
you can spare; and with help enough he is confident
we can save the steamer, and take her into port,” continued
the fourth lieutenant.</p>

<p>“How many of our ship’s company can we spare,
Mr. Marline?” asked the captain, turning to the adult
boatswain, who had been called to hear the report of
the lieutenant.</p>

<p>“We can get along well enough with one watch,”
replied the old salt.</p>

<p>“That was just my view of the matter,” added the
captain. “But I will not detail either watch as a
whole. There will be a great deal of hard and dirty
work to be done on board of the steamer, and I will
call for volunteers.”</p>

<p>All hands were piped to muster in form, for they
had already come on deck to witness the expected
arrival of the passengers from the wreck. The seamen
laid hold of the life-lines and such parts of the vessel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
as afforded them a hold, and waited impatiently to
learn what was to be done. Capt. Wainwright made a
speech in which he explained the situation on board of
the steamer. She was to be saved and sent into port
if possible. This announcement was greeted with yells
and cheers.</p>

<p>“I purpose to select a crew to man the steamer,”
continued Wainwright. “The work on board of her
will be difficult, and some of it very dirty and disagreeable.
I shall therefore call for volunteers.”</p>

<p>“Stop, Wainwright!” suddenly interposed Mr.
Primback, who had crawled on deck in season to hear
the last part of the captain’s speech, after one of the
stewards had informed him what was transpiring on
board.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, Professor Primback; but this
business admits of no delay,” replied the captain,
vexed at the interruption of the “philosopher.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean, Wainwright, by sending half
the students out of the vessel without saying a word to
me?” demanded the irate instructor.</p>

<p>“I have consulted with Mr. Marline, as you desired,
sir; and I don’t think there is any other way to do.”</p>

<p>“But I object. You have taken the ship a long way
out of her course; and here you are wasting your time
and mine in some Quixotic adventure.”</p>

<p>“Have you been informed that Mr. Frisbone, the
gentleman who presented the American Prince to the
principal, is on board of that steamer, with his wife
and her sister, sir?”</p>

<p>“I have been so informed; but that don’t affect the
case at all. You sent a boat to convey them on board<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
of this vessel, which was a very proper thing to do, as
it involved the possible saving of human life. To that
I did not object: I do not now object to such just and
proper action as may be necessary to insure the safety
of any persons on board of the unfortunate vessel,”
continued Mr. Primback, whose speech became more
precise and dignified as he cooled off. “I do not
propose to interfere with the management of the vessel;
but when you indicate your intention to send away
one-half of my pupils on a boyish expedition of very
doubtful practicability, I feel it to be my duty to interfere
as one having authority.”</p>

<p>“I shall be very sorry to do any thing without your
approval, Professor Primback,” replied Wainwright, in
a very respectful tone.</p>

<p>“Do I understand you to mean by that, you intend
to proceed with the plan you have just announced
without my sanction, and even in opposition to my
direct prohibition?” demanded Mr. Primback, controlling
his wrath as well as he could.</p>

<p>“I hope you will not compel me to do any thing of
the kind, sir.”</p>

<p>“I understand you perfectly, Wainwright. You are
prepared, I see, to set at defiance my authority,” continued
the professor, biting his lips to repress his anger.</p>

<p>“I should like to speak with you a few moments,
brother Primback,” interposed Dr. Crumples, the other
instructor of the Tritonia.</p>

<p>“I am ready to hear any thing you have to say, doctor,”
replied Mr. Primback coldly.</p>

<p>Though the two professors never quarrelled, or exhibited
any signs of variance, before the students, there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
was no sympathy whatever between them. Dr. Crumples
was a genial, good-natured man, rather fond of a
joke; while the other cared for nothing but Greek,
Latin, science, and philosophy.</p>

<p>“I have been reading the regulations, and I have
come to the conclusion that you and I have nothing to
do or say about the nautical affairs of this vessel,” said
the doctor, in a low tone, not intended for the ears of
the students.</p>

<p>“Do you intend to sustain the boys in their resistance
to my authority, Dr. Crumples?” demanded the
philosopher, straightening himself up to the full height
of his dignity.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for him, in doing this he let go of the
life-line; and a sudden jerk of the vessel would have
pitched him down into the scuppers if Marline had not
seized him by the arm, and held him. He came down
from his dignity all in a heap. The students turned
away to hide the laugh they could not suppress.</p>

<p>“I certainly do not intend to sustain the boys in
their resistance to your authority, for the simple reason
that I don’t believe you have any authority in the
premises. If you will come into the cabin, where both
of us will be more at ease than on this unstable deck,
I shall be happy to explain my view of the case,” replied
Dr. Crumples, when his associate was fairly
planted on his legs again.</p>

<p>“I do not care to know your opinion of the case,
Dr. Crumples,” added Mr. Primback tartly.</p>

<p>“You know it already, professor,” chuckled the
doctor.</p>

<p>“I am the senior professor of the ship, with full
powers to direct every thing”—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>“In the scholastic department,” interposed the doctor.</p>

<p>“Do you suppose I am placed here to follow the
lead of a boy?” demanded Mr. Primback, pointing at
the captain of the Tritonia in the most contemptuous
manner.</p>

<p>In releasing his hold upon the life-line he was in
great danger of being upset again, and Marline grasped
his arm, this time so vigorously that the professor
groaned with pain. Possibly the old salt was disgusted
with the “philosopher,” and expressed his feeling in
this way.</p>

<p>“Do you mean to break my arm, Mr. Marline?”</p>

<p>“I beg your honor’s pardon, but I was afraid you
were going to be shied into the scuppers again,”
pleaded the boatswain.</p>

<p>“I shall call for volunteers, my lads,” Capt. Wainwright
continued, resuming his speech to the ship’s
company where he had left off.</p>

<p>“You will not call for volunteers, Wainwright!”
interposed Mr. Primback warmly. “I forbid you to
call for volunteers! I forbid any student to volunteer!
It is my order that you proceed on the voyage to Madeira,
according to the direction of the principal.”</p>

<p>“Shall I leave Mr. Frisbone and the ladies to perish
on the wreck?” asked the captain mildly.</p>

<p>“I have already given you permission to bring them
on board of the Tritonia. You may still do that,”
replied the senior professor.</p>

<p>“But the ladies decline to get into the boat while the
sea is so rough.”</p>

<p>“Is it possible to get the ladies into the boat, Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
Marline?” asked the professor, turning to the boatswain.</p>

<p>“I suppose we could hoist them into the boat by
main force; but they said they preferred to drown
where they were, rather than slide down on a rope into
the cutter,” replied the boatswain, rather doggedly.
“If we can save the steamer we ought to do it, in my
judgment.”</p>

<p>“We have nothing to do with saving the vessel. We
are not out upon the ocean for any such purpose.”</p>

<p>“Just as your honor pleases.”</p>

<p>“If the ladies will not get into the boat, you must
either force them to do so, or leave them where they
are,” added Mr. Primback.</p>

<p>Wainwright said nothing more. It could make no
difference to him if the senior professor did forbid any
further action towards the saving of the steamer. His
action was approved by all the other adults on board;
and he was confident that the officers and seamen
would obey his orders, possibly with greater readiness
than if the head of the scholastic department had not
forbidden them to do so.</p>

<p>The Tritonia had filled away again on the return of
the second cutter from the wreck. By this time it was
necessary to come about again, and stand towards the
steamer. Wainwright politely notified Mr. Primback
that the vessel was about to “go in stays;” hoping that
he would retire to the cabin, and permit him to finish
the business of the hour.</p>

<p>“Go in stays! Will you ever speak English, Wainwright?
Do you mean to insult me by using that gibberish
to me when I have forbidden you to do so?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>“That is the proper nautical expression for what we
are about to do,” replied the captain.</p>

<p>“Do you mean that you are going to turn the
vessel?”</p>

<p>“That is substantially what we intend to do; but
sailors would not understand me if I called it turning
the vessel.”</p>

<p>“Do you presume to instruct me in the use of language,
Wainwright?”</p>

<p>“By no means, sir; but I use nautical language as I
was instructed to use it by Mr. Lowington and the
other instructors in seamanship and navigation.—Mr.
Greenwood, let the vessel go in stays,” continued the
captain, turning to the first lieutenant.</p>

<p>“Man the fore and main sheets!” called the executive
officer. “Ease down the helm!”</p>

<p>As the vessel came up into the wind in obedience to
her helm, the fore and main sheet began to bang and
thrash as the pressure was removed.</p>

<p>“Haul in on the sheets,” called the first lieutenant;
and the order was repeated by the other officers in
charge of the sheets.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid you will get hit by the sheet-blocks if
you stand here any longer, sir,” said Mr. Marline to
Professor Primback. “Excuse me, sir, but you had
better go below, or the vessel will shake you up badly
as she catches the wind on the other tack.”</p>

<p>The professor made a dive at the companion-way.
As the vessel at that instant was on an even keel, he
succeeded in reaching his destination. The line of
seamen “walking away” with the fore-sheet then
crowded upon him, and he fled to the cabin in disgust.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
The Tritonia gave a terrible lurch as the sails
filled on the port tack; and the grouty professor, losing
his hold of the stair-post, was pitched down to the lee
side of the cabin. One of the stewards picked him
up; but his temper got the better of him. Dr. Crumples
tried to comfort him; but he would not be comforted.</p>

<p>The Tritonia was again headed towards the steamer.
The captain took some time to consult with Mr. Marline
and Mr. Rimmer in regard to the detail of officers
and seamen for duty on the disabled vessel. Then he
had a talk with O’Hara, though no one could hear
what passed between them. All hands were again
called; and every one on board volunteered, as the
captain had told Marline they would.</p>

<p>“Perhaps, when I have explained the duties of the
crew on board of the steamer, you will not be so willing,”
said the captain, with a laugh. “It will be necessary
for a portion of the volunteers to act as firemen;
and I need not tell you that the fire-room of any
steamer is a very hot and dirty hole. But this work
will be fairly divided among all the seamen.”</p>

<p>“But not among the officers,” added a young salt,
laughing.</p>

<p>“Certainly not: I shall detail two officers for duty
in the engine-room; but I select them simply because
they understand the business,” replied the captain.
“Lieut. O’Hara will act as captain of the steamer;
first master Speers as chief officer; second master
Raymond as second officer.”</p>

<p>These names were received with cheers by the seamen;
but the three lieutenants whose names had not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
been mentioned thought it a little strange that they
had been passed over, though the third lieutenant,
Alexander, was competent to run an engine, which explained
why his name had been omitted.</p>

<p>“Lieut. Alexander will act as chief engineer, and
fourth master Richards as assistant,” continued the
captain, reading from a paper he had made out.</p>

<p>The names of eighteen seamen and petty officers
were then read; and Wainwright desired any one who
had any objections to make, to make them now, for it
would be too late when the party had gone on board of
the steamer. No one made any objections; and the
order was given to clear away the second and third
cutters. They were lowered into the water, one at a
time, and their crews pulled for the steamer. Mr.
Rimmer, the second cook, and two stewards were sent
with them.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII.<br>

<small>THE INVALID YOUNG LADY.</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WHEN Professor Primback heard the noise of
lowering the boats into the water, he wrote a
formal order to the captain not to send away any portion
of the ship’s company, unless it was to bring
off the passengers of the steamer. He signed his
name in full to this document, and sent it on deck by
one of the stewards. Wainwright took the paper, read
it attentively, and then put it into his pocket. He
took no further notice of it.</p>

<p>The senior professor evidently supposed that no
notice would be taken of the order, and he seemed to
be aware that he had no means of enforcing his commands;
for he went to his state-room, and made no
further demonstration. He did not even speak to Dr.
Crumples about the matter.</p>

<p>As the crew of the steamer had taken the boats with
them when they abandoned her, the second and third
cutters of the Tritonia were to be retained by the party.
In half an hour they were all on board the steamer,
with the boats hoisted up at the davits. O’Hara reported
what had been done on board of the Tritonia
to Mr. Frisbone, and informed him that he had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
appointed captain of the steamer, or, at least, of the
party sent to assist in saving her.</p>

<p>“Capt. O’Hara, I greet you! and the captain of the
Tritonia could not have selected a better captain, without
speaking ill of the other officers; for I know how
well you managed some very difficult business in Italy
last fall,” said Mr. Frisbone. “Now will you introduce
me to the rest of your officers?”</p>

<p>O’Hara presented them one at a time, and the
American Prince shook hands with each. When he
came to Mr. Alexander, he gave one of his loud and
hearty laughs.</p>

<p>“I thought I was to be chief engineer,” said he,
wringing the hand of Alexander; “but I am willing to
place myself under your orders, Mr. Chief Engineer.”</p>

<p>“He is the chief engineer as far as our party is concerned,”
O’Hara explained. “Though Capt. Wainwright
is the commander of the Tritonia in name and
in fact, so far as doing duty is concerned, yet the
vice-principal is really the captain. If you please, Mr.
Frisbone, we shall all regard you as the principal, on
board of the steamer.”</p>

<p>“All right, Capt. O’Hara,” replied the Prince, who
seemed to take great delight in giving the young officers
their full titles, and using them often.</p>

<p>“I shall be glad to take my orders from you; and
the chief engineer will do the same,” added O’Hara.</p>

<p>“Possibly the chief engineer knows more about running
an engine than I do; and I know more about
building them than I do of running them.”</p>

<p>“Of course I shall give in to you, sir,” said Alexander.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>“Thank you; but do you really know any thing
about an engine, Mr. Alexander?” asked Mr. Frisbone,
in his teasing tone.</p>

<p>“Two years ago I was assistant engineer on a screw
steamer about the size of this one,” answered Alexander.</p>

<p>“And how old were you two years ago?”</p>

<p>“I was eighteen, sir. My father received a legacy
from an uncle in Scotland, which made him a rich
man; and then I was sent to this institution to finish
my education. I had worked two years in a machine-shop
before I went to sea at all. I think I can run an
engine, sir.”</p>

<p>“I have no doubt you can; in fact, I believe these
young gentlemen can do any thing that anybody can,”
added Mr. Frisbone, laughing heartily; and sometimes
no one could imagine what he was laughing at.</p>

<p>“The second engineer ran a stationary engine when
he was twelve years old, in his father’s shop,” continued
O’Hara, when he had presented this officer.</p>

<p>“And I was engineer of a small steam-yacht when
I was fourteen,” added Richards.</p>

<p>“All right, young gentlemen; and I shall have
nothing to do but sleep in the cabin, and take care of
the women-folks,” chuckled the Prince.</p>

<p>“I think some of our officers will be quite willing to
assist you in that part of your duty,” said O’Hara
lightly. “Upon my loife, the young lady is as beautiful
as the lovely Giulia Fabiano; and, by the powers,
that’s saying a great dale!”</p>

<p>“By the way, now I think of it, is there a young
gentleman in the squadron by the name of Speers,—Tom
Speers?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>“There is, sir; and he is one of our party,” replied
O’Hara. “Where are ye, Tom Speers?”</p>

<p>Tom had been introduced; but the Prince evidently
did not notice the name, for he had called him “Mr.
Spear,” when he addressed him. Tom came forward
when his name was called.</p>

<p>“How is it you happen to be here, Mr. Speers?”
asked the Prince.</p>

<p>“I was detailed to act as chief officer of this vessel,
by the captain of the Tritonia, sir,” replied Tom, wondering
how Mr. Frisbone happened to know any thing
about him.</p>

<p>“I know; but you were sent for by my friend Judge
Rodwood, to go to England.”</p>

<p>“I did not go, sir.”</p>

<p>“Well, we won’t stop to talk about that now. We
must go to work on the steamer at once, and have her
in good condition in case another storm comes on,”
said Mr. Frisbone, suddenly changing his tone and
manner.</p>

<p>But, before the officers left the cabin, he introduced
them to his wife and her sister; then the party took a
look at the vessel below. Mr. Rimmer had been studying
the hole in the starboard bow since he came on
board, and by this time he was hard at work repairing
the damage. Two seamen, who had a taste for carpentry,
were detailed to assist him. Until the hole was
stopped, nothing could be done towards righting the
vessel; for she lay just in the proper position to enable
the carpenter to do his work to the best advantage.</p>

<p>Mr. Rimmer intended to do the job in a much more
thorough manner than he had at first proposed, for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
reason that he found the materials for it on board.
He proceeded to splice the broken ribs, and then to
plank them over, as the work would have been done in
a ship-yard. A stage was rigged, and lowered over the
side; and, while the carpenter was getting out his stock,
his assistants removed the broken planking. The
heavy rolling of the vessel interfered very much with
operations on the stage; but the workmen were very
zealous, and made good progress in spite of all the
disadvantages.</p>

<p>In the mean time Mr. Frisbone and the rest of the
ship’s company were preparing to right the steamer,
and pump the water out of her, as soon as this work
could be undertaken. The steam-pump was put in
good order; and every thing about the vessel was restored
to its usual condition, so far as it was possible
to do so.</p>

<p>In the afternoon the wind abated almost to a calm,
and a boat came from the Tritonia to pay the steamer
a visit. Mr. Marline was in it, with one of the stewards
who had been a ship-carpenter. Both of them went to
work with Mr. Rimmer, and before dark the hole was
planked over. As there were some indications of bad
weather again, the Tritonia’s boat returned, and Mr.
Rimmer and his assistants proceeded to calk the seams
by the light of the lanterns. By midnight the job was
completed, even to coppering the part below the water-line.</p>

<p>Before eight bells in the evening, the ship’s company
had been divided into two watches, as in the merchant
service. One watch had turned in at eight bells; but
all hands were called at midnight, when the repairs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
were finished. At this time the steam-pump was started,
and it discharged the water at a very rapid rate.
Mr. Rimmer followed the water as it receded in the
hold, to ascertain if there was any leak in the bottom;
but none was found.</p>

<p>The steamer had for a cargo the parts of an iron
bridge, and the labels upon them indicated that it was
consigned to a firm in Barcelona. One of the heaviest
of the pieces had shifted from its position in the hold,
throwing others out of place, till their weight had heeled
the vessel over as the party had found her.</p>

<p>“Well, Capt. O’Hara, do you think you can stow
this cargo over again so as to right the vessel?” asked
Mr. Frisbone, when the pump had worked long enough
to afford them a full view of the condition of the hold.</p>

<p>“I have no doubt I can,” replied O’Hara confidently.</p>

<p>“But some of those pieces weigh several tons,”
suggested the Prince.</p>

<p>“But we have a donkey-engine on deck; and, with
snatch-blocks, we can apply the power in any direction
we desire.”</p>

<p>“Precisely so: I see that you are master of the
situation.”</p>

<p>The captain had already caused the necessary blocks
and rigging to be collected in the hold. The assistant
engineer was stationed at the donkey-engine, the
snatch-blocks were arranged for moving the heaviest
piece of the bridge, and the rope was adjusted. A
chain sling was attached to the iron, and the line made
fast to it.</p>

<p>“Go ahead!” said O’Hara, when every thing was
ready; and the order was passed along the line of seamen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
until it reached the officer in charge of the donkey-engine.</p>

<p>The rope straightened and strained as the power was
applied; and then the huge mass of iron began slowly
to move in the required direction. Mr. Rimmer and
his gang placed the skids, and in the course of half an
hour the piece was moved to the place indicated by the
carpenter. The steamer came up on an even keel as
the heavy weight changed position.</p>

<p>“But she is down too much by the stern,” said Mr.
Rimmer, when the piece had been blocked securely in
its place.</p>

<p>“I see why that is,” added the Prince. “Half a
dozen of those tube pieces have rolled out of the places
where they were first stowed.”</p>

<p>These were restored to their original beds as indicated
by the blocking; and they had doubtless been
thrown out of place by the shifting of the larger piece.</p>

<p>“The vessel is in good trim now,” said Mr. Rimmer,
wiping the perspiration from his brow. “Those pieces
will not move again unless the steamer goes over on
her beam-ends.”</p>

<p>The party left the hold, and hastened on deck. The
weather was still mild, though the sky was clouded
over. The captain sent an order to the chief engineer,
directing him to get up steam. The fires had been
started in the furnaces; but only steam enough had been
made to work the donkey-engine, which was not furnished
with a separate boiler, as in many vessels.</p>

<p>The amateur firemen had been fully instructed in
their duties by Mr. Frisbone, who remained in the fire-room
till morning. Thus far the seamen considered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
the hot and dirty work as good fun; but they were not
likely to hold this opinion for any length of time.
Four hands had been detailed from each watch to
serve as firemen; and these were to work two at a
time, so that only two hours’ service were required of
each, or six hours a day. The fire-room was well
ventilated, so that it was not so intensely hot as in
many steamers. A lot of cast-off woollen shirts and
trousers had been brought from the Tritonia for the
use of the firemen.</p>

<p>Mr. Frisbone did not like the looks of the quarters
occupied by the French sailors and firemen; and he
insisted that the seamen should be berthed in the cabin.
There were state-rooms enough to accommodate them
all; but the part of the cabin used by the officers was
separated from that of the seamen by a curtain sliding
on a brass rod.</p>

<p>The steamer was the Ville d’Angers. She was evidently
a nearly new vessel, of about six hundred tons.
Unlike most of the English steamers, she had a pilot-house
forward, as in American vessels of this kind.
Her cabin was handsomely fitted up, and she appeared
to be a first-class steamer in every respect.</p>

<p>O’Hara went into the pilot-house, when the work
below was completed. Tom Speers followed him, for
there was nothing more to be done till the engineer
should report that he had steam enough to start her.</p>

<p>“This will be a big spree, my boy,” said the captain,
as he seated himself by the wheel.</p>

<p>“The biggest that ever happened. I am amazed to
find myself in it,” replied Tom. “I don’t see how I
came to be appointed to the second place on board,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
when there are so many fellows above me that wanted
to take a hand in this business.”</p>

<p>“You don’t see it? Then I’ll tell you, my boy,”
added the captain with a jolly laugh, as though he enjoyed
the situation.</p>

<p>“I suppose you helped me into the place.”</p>

<p>“Troth, I did, thin! You see, when a fellow like you,
rotten with stamps, with millions in prospect, and a letter
of credit for thousands in his trousers-pocket, comes
along, it is well to get on the right side of him,” continued
O’Hara, laughing all the time.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe the money had any thing to do with
it,” protested Tom. “You are the farthest from a selfish
fellow of all the ship’s company; and I won’t
believe what you say of yourself.”</p>

<p>“Thank you for so much, my lad. But I’ll bet a
hackle, if the fellows knew how rich you are, they
would say that’s the rayson. When Capt. Wainwright
told me beforehand that he should give me the command
of the steamer, which he didn’t do till he had
talked it over with Mr. Marline, he asked me to tell
him who I wanted for officers. Your name was the
first I gave him; so don’t forget me when you make
your will.”</p>

<p>“I certainly will not if I have any thing to leave,”
replied Tom.</p>

<p>“Steam up!” shouted Alexander through the speaking-tube
which connected with the engine-room.</p>

<p>“Then we are all ready to go ahead. Have you
seen the Tritonia’s lights lately, Tom?” said O’Hara,
looking out in the direction from which they had been
last seen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>“I have not: we have all been so busy that we have
not thought of her. She has been standing off and on
all night, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“There she is, astern of us,” added O’Hara. “We
must run down and report the state of things on board
to the captain. Call the quartermaster and a seaman
to take the wheel, if you please, Tom.”</p>

<p>The two hands were called into the pilot-house, and
the quartermaster was given the charge of the wheel.
The other hand was required to assist him, for the
officers had not yet learned how much force was needed
to steer the steamer.</p>

<p>“Do you know any thing about these jinglers, Burley?”
asked the captain, as the quartermaster took the
wheel.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir: the chief engineer told me all about
them,” replied Burley.</p>

<p>“Start her, then,” added the captain.</p>

<p>The quartermaster pulled the bell-handle on the
wheel-frame. The hissing steam was heard below; the
vessel jarred a little; and then she went ahead.</p>

<p>“The course, if you please?” inquired the quartermaster.</p>

<p>“Run for the Tritonia; but be sure you don’t run
over her,” replied O’Hara. “She is astern of us now.”</p>

<p>“For the Tritonia, sir,” repeated Burley, as he threw
the wheel over.</p>

<p>“We are actually moving!” said O’Hara, as he left
the pilot-house, followed by Speers.</p>

<p>“I think there is no doubt of that,” replied the chief
officer. “Have you any idea where we are going?”</p>

<p>“Not the least in the world; but, the nearer the port,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
the shorter our term of office. I wish we were bound
to New York, or some other port on the other side of
the ocean; for I should like a long cruise under present
circumstances.”</p>

<p>“So should I; but I suppose we shall have only a
day or two of it at the most.”</p>

<p>“We shall soon know where we are going; for I
suppose Capt. Wainwright has been studying on that
question since he sent us on board of the steamer.”</p>

<p>O’Hara then directed that the starboard watch, which
had been on duty all night, should be relieved. It was
two o’clock in the morning, and they were to be called
at four. This was Tom Speers’s watch; but he was
not inclined to turn in before the captain had reported
to the Tritonia. Raymond was now in charge of the
deck, and Tom had nothing to do. He went into the
cabin, and to his surprise found that Miss Rodwood
was there.</p>

<p>Tom touched his cap to her, and remarked that she
was up late. There had been so much noise in the
hold, that she could not sleep, and she had got up.
The officer seated himself on a divan, and he could
not keep his eyes off the fair passenger.</p>

<p>Miss Rodwood was walking up and down the cabin;
and Tom could not help thinking again that she was
a very pretty girl. She was very pale, and no doubt her
recent experience on shipboard had been a severe trial
to her nerves. Tom noticed that there was something
very strange about her expression. He could not
explain it; but he was confident that she was suffering
from some cause. She did not seem to be in bodily
pain. The motion of the vessel was tolerably easy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
compared with what it had been, so that she had no
difficulty in walking on the cabin floor. The curtain
partition was open on one side of the table, so that the
lady extended her walk to the entire length of the
apartment.</p>

<p>She kept quickening her pace till she was going
almost at a run; but she moderated it as she approached
the young officer. Tom watched her with
increasing interest, as she appeared to grow more excited.
He was sure now that something was the matter
with her; and he felt that something ought to be
done for her.</p>

<p>“The weather has been very favorable for our
work,” said Tom, desiring to ascertain something more
about the lady’s condition through the medium of conversation.</p>

<p>“I suppose it has,” she replied, with a nod, and continued
her walk.</p>

<p>Tom saw that her eye looked a little wild. He
decided that he ought to inform Mr. Frisbone of her
condition, though he hardly understood enough of such
matters to determine whether any thing was the matter
with her.</p>

<p>While he was thinking of the case, he saw Miss
Rodwood ascend a flight of stairs in the forward part
of the cabin, leading to the hurricane-deck. He rushed
out at the main entrance, and ran up the ladder. The
lady was walking very fast towards the stern of the
vessel. He concluded that she had come up to take
the air; and she would certainly regard it as impertinent
for him to follow her. He paused to consider
what he should do.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>He saw O’Hara planking the main deck from the
waist forward. He would speak to him, and ask him
to send for Mr. Frisbone. He descended to the main
deck, and hailed the captain.</p>

<p>“I thought you had turned in, my boy,” said the
captain lightly.</p>

<p>“No: I thought I would stay up till you have communicated
with the Tritonia,” replied Tom. “Have
you noticed any thing strange about the young lady on
board, O’Hara?”</p>

<p>“Upon me sowl, I haven’t, except that she is as
pretty a girl as I have set eyes on for seven years; and
that’s saying a great dale,” answered the captain.</p>

<p>“Don’t joke, please, just now, O’Hara. I think something
ails the young lady; and I’m afraid it’s something
serious,” added Tom.</p>

<p>“You don’t mane it! What could ail a girl as
pretty as she is?”</p>

<p>Tom took five minutes to tell what he had observed
in the cabin.</p>

<p>“Is it crazy she is? Is that what you mane?”
demanded O’Hara, not a little excited by the inference
he drew from what his companion had said.</p>

<p>“You needn’t call it by any such name as that. I
believe she is an invalid; and, after all she has been
through during the last twenty-four hours, it wouldn’t
be very strange if she were a little out of her head. I
don’t like to lose sight of her. There she is, walking
up and down the poop-deck as though she were running
a race with her own shadow. Will you send one
of the watch down to tell Mr. Frisbone how it is with
her, or ask him to come on deck without saying what
is wanted?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>“Troth, I’ll do so myself!” replied the captain, hurrying
down through the engine-room.</p>

<p>He had hardly disappeared before Miss Rodwood
started to run with all her might towards the stern of
the steamer. Tom Speers leaped up the ladder to the
hurricane-deck in season to see her spring over the
low railing into the sea.</p>

<p>“Man overboard! man overboard! Stop her!”
cried Tom at the top of his lungs; and they were not
feeble lungs.</p>

<p>He cut loose the life-buoy which was lashed to the
railing, and threw it overboard. But Tom was not
content with this action: he kicked off his shoes, and
stepped out of his heavy pea-jacket and coat at the
same moment, and plunged into the sea.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII.<br>

<small>THE VILLE D’ANGERS.</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">“HELP, help! Save me!” cried Miss Rodwood
in the water, at some distance from Tom
Speers.</p>

<p>As the girl had voluntarily thrown herself into the
sea, Tom could not understand why she called for assistance.
He had struck the water only a few seconds
after she sprang overboard, and she could not be at
any great distance from him. He was a strong swimmer,
and the sea was very smooth. He heard the cry
of the girl repeated as he came up with the life-buoy
he had thrown overboard. Placing it before him, he
swam with all the speed he could make, and reached
the sufferer when she was quite exhausted by her efforts.
She could swim a little herself, and had more confidence
in the water than most persons who had never
tried to do so.</p>

<p>“Don’t be afraid!” cried Tom, when he saw in the
gloom of the night that she was still struggling to keep
afloat.</p>

<p>In a moment more he reached her, and placed her
hands upon the life-buoy, which was buoyant enough
to support both of them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>“You are perfectly safe now,” said Tom, as he
assured himself that she had a good hold upon the
buoy.</p>

<p>She was too much exhausted to make any reply;
and, whatever she had intended in the beginning, it
was clear enough to Tom that she had no present desire
to end her young life.</p>

<p>Capt. O’Hara had hardly entered the engine-room,
when he heard the energetic cry of Tom Speers; and
he realized in an instant that the worst his friend feared
had come to pass.</p>

<p>“Man overboard! Stop her, Alexander!” he shouted
to the chief engineer, who was watching the motions
of the machinery.</p>

<p>The captain told the engineer to pass the word for
Mr. Frisbone. He returned to the main deck; but Raymond,
the second officer, had heard the startling cry.
Already the third cutter was swung out, and all the
watch on deck were in the boat. The officers and seamen
had been thoroughly trained to this sort of service,
and there had been no more delay than if they had
been on board of the Tritonia. The crew lowered
themselves into the water, as there was no difficulty in
doing in a smooth sea. The falls were cast off, and
the cutter shoved away from the steamer. The four
oars were shipped, and the crew pulled with all their
muscle.</p>

<p>“Pull directly astern of the vessel!” shouted O’Hara,
who had gone upon the hurricane-deck, where he could
see all that was done.</p>

<p>“Ay, ay, sir!” replied the quartermaster, who, as
the highest in rank, had taken the place of the coxswain;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
for the boat-service of the steamer was not yet
organized, and it was not the practice in the vessels of
the squadron to wait for the regular officers and crew
of the boats in any emergency.</p>

<p>“Call all hands, Mr. Raymond,” said the captain to
the officer of the deck.</p>

<p>As there was not another seaman left on the deck of
the Ville d’Angers, Raymond performed this duty himself.</p>

<p>“Man overboard! All hands on deck!” cried Raymond,
as he passed into the cabin, and proceeded to
open the doors of all the state-rooms occupied by the
crew.</p>

<p>“What is the matter?” asked Mrs. Frisbone, coming
out of her room.</p>

<p>“Man overboard, madam,” replied the second officer.</p>

<p>“Man overboard! Who is it?” asked the terrified
lady.</p>

<p>“I’m sure I don’t know who it is, madam.”</p>

<p>As it was a “man overboard,” it did not occur to
her that the unfortunate person could be her sister;
but, fearing that the invalid might be alarmed at the
unusual noise, she went to her room, and found she
was not there.</p>

<p>“Where is my sister?” asked Mrs. Frisbone, very
much startled by the discovery she had made.</p>

<p>“I don’t know, madam,” replied Raymond. “I saw
her walking on the hurricane-deck a while ago. I will
see if she is there now.”</p>

<p>The second officer left the cabin; and, finding the
captain on the upper deck, he asked if he had seen
Miss Rodwood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>“She is overboard,” replied the captain.</p>

<p>“My sister overboard!” exclaimed Mrs. Frisbone,
who had followed Raymond from the cabin.</p>

<p>“I am sorry to say she is, madam,” added O’Hara;
“but I think she will be saved. Mr. Speers leaped
in after her only a few seconds after she went over.”</p>

<p>“Did she fall into the water?” demanded the excited
lady.</p>

<p>“She jumped over the railing herself, madam,” answered
O’Hara, as gently as he could utter the disagreeable
words.</p>

<p>“Impossible! She could not have intended to end
her life,” groaned the agonized sister.</p>

<p>The captain was explaining what had passed in the
cabin before the catastrophe, when Mr. Frisbone joined
them. He was astounded at the intelligence conveyed
to him.</p>

<p>“Have you suspected that she was out of her head,
Maggie?” he inquired.</p>

<p>“I have not seen a single indication of any thing of
the kind,” she replied.</p>

<p>“I was on my way to the fire-room to call you, at
the request of Mr. Speers, who was sure something was
the matter with her, when I heard the cry of ‘Man
overboard,’” added O’Hara.</p>

<p>“I wish he had called me,” said Mrs. Frisbone, with
a shudder.</p>

<p>“Don’t be alarmed, madam: I am confident she will
be saved,” continued the captain, looking out into the
darkness astern of the ship.</p>

<p>“I am sure I did not suspect any thing of this kind.
She seemed to be quite cheerful and happy when she
retired,” mused Mrs. Frisbone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>“Hurrah! hurrah!” shouted the boat’s crew, in the
gloom, where they could not be seen.</p>

<p>“That means good news,” said the captain. “They
have her in the boat by this time.”</p>

<p>The party on the deck listened for further sounds in
the direction from which the cheers had come. In a
few moments they heard the measured stroke of oars
at some distance from the ship. Raymond had ordered
up all the lanterns on board, which were taken to the
gangway.</p>

<p>“Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah!” shouted the crew of
the third cutter, as the boat approached the steamer.</p>

<p>The party descended from the hurricane-deck, and
gathered at the gangway, where the accommodation
steps had been rigged by Raymond’s directions. The
cutter came up to the platform; and Tom Speers, taking
the shivering invalid in his arms, bore her up the
steps, and into the cabin.</p>

<p>She was too cold, and exhausted by her struggles in
the water, to speak. Tom laid her in the berth, and all
retired but her sister. Her wet clothing was removed,
and she was wrapped in blankets. In half an hour she
was warm and comfortable. Her improved condition
was reported by the Prince to the interested officers.</p>

<p>“What induced you to do such a thing?” asked
Mrs. Frisbone. “Are you tired of living, Louise?”</p>

<p>“Far from it, Maggie! I don’t know what made
me do it. I can’t explain it. I certainly had no intention
of jumping overboard. An impulse came over
me, and I could not resist it. I have hardly slept a
wink for two nights, and I was very nervous.”</p>

<p>This was all the explanation the invalid could give<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
of the rash act she had attempted. She insisted that
the bath had done her good, and that she was no longer
vexed by the morbid fancies which had troubled her
since the collision. She expressed her gratitude in the
strongest terms to the young gentleman who had gone
to her assistance; and she was sure she should have
drowned without his aid, for she felt that she was sinking
when he brought the life-buoy to her.</p>

<p>Mrs. Frisbone would not leave her again that night,
though the invalid declared that she should go to sleep
at once; and she did as soon as the explanations were
finished. In the mean time Tom Speers had gone to
his state-room, and changed his wet clothes for dry
ones, and was no worse for his bath.</p>

<p>“Mr. Speers, you have laid me and my wife under a
load of obligation that I shall never feel like getting
rid of,” said the Prince, as the young hero came out of
his room. “I like that girl as though she was my own
daughter; and you have done more for me than any
living man could do, unless it was to save my wife from
drowning in the same way.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry you feel that way about it, sir,” replied
Tom, laughing; “for I don’t like to have anybody feel
that he owes me too much.”</p>

<p>“You are more than ten times the feller I supposed
you was, Mr. Speers; and I have heard a good deal
about you within the last week or two.”</p>

<p>“What have you heard about me, sir?” asked Tom
curiously.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you some other time,” answered the Prince.
“I must go and look out for the firemen, for they are
very green in their new duties, and I’m afraid they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
will catch cold when the watch is shifted: it is just like
boys to go on deck to cool off when they leave the
fire-room.”</p>

<p>Mr. Frisbone disappeared in the engine-room, and
Tom went forward. He had a long talk with O’Hara
about the adventure of the night, in which the captain
did not spare the praise he felt that the bold fellow
deserved.</p>

<p>“Upon my sowl, the Prince would make you a rich
man if he could; but, by the powers, you have got
ahead of him, and it’ll be no use. You are richer than
he is, and he can’t do any thing for you in that way.”</p>

<p>“I hope not; for I should feel insulted if a man
offered me money for that sort of service,” replied the
high-toned young officer. “I feel as much at home in
the water as I do on this deck; and, if I saw anybody
in the water, I couldn’t help going in after him, if he
needed help.”</p>

<p>“That’s the ginerous nature you have, my boy! It’s
a wonder you wasn’t born in ould Ireland or Italy.”</p>

<p>“The Tritonia is close aboard of us,” said the officer
of the deck, touching his cap to the captain.</p>

<p>“I see she is: slow down, if you please, Mr. Raymond,”
replied O’Hara. “We shall soon know now to
what port we are bound.”</p>

<p>“I think I can go to sleep when I know that,” added
Tom.</p>

<p>The Tritonia had made a long tack in standing off
and on; and, when she was at the greatest distance
from the Ville d’Angers, the wind had died out. She
was rolling in the long swells with all sail set, but making
no progress through the water. The Ville d’Angers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
ran across her wake, and within hailing distance of
her.</p>

<p>“On board of the steamer!” called the officer of the
deck.</p>

<p>“On board the Tritonia!” replied Raymond, prompted
by the captain.</p>

<p>“The captain desires Mr. O’Hara to report in person,”
added the officer of the schooner.</p>

<p>“All ready with the third cutter,” said the captain.</p>

<p>The boat was lowered into the water, and pulled off
with O’Hara on board. In a few moments he was on
the quarter-deck of the Tritonia. Capt. Wainwright had
been called when the steamer was made out by the
watch, and he immediately came on deck.</p>

<p>O’Hara reported in full concerning his action since
he had taken possession of the steamer. He declared
that the Ville d’Angers was in good seaworthy condition
in every respect. She was abundantly supplied
with coal, water, and provisions.</p>

<p>“It seems very remarkable that we should pick up
Mr. Frisbone and his wife in a disabled vessel,” said
Capt. Wainwright, when O’Hara had finished his report,
which closed with the catastrophe of Miss Rodwood.
“It would perhaps have been better if the
American Prince had happened to come to the relief
of the Ville d’Angers.”</p>

<p>“But better the Tritonia than neither,” added
O’Hara.</p>

<p>“There would have been a certain fitness in the
American Prince saving her former owner from the
perils of the sea.”</p>

<p>“Indade there would!” exclaimed the captain of
the steamer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>“But I suppose you want your orders; and I confess
that I have been in a great deal of doubt. Professor
Primback is so much incensed against me, that he won’t
speak to me. I have asked his advice in regard to
what to do; but he will not say any thing. He says I
am in the attitude of rebellion against his authority.
He insists that I shall call back the students I have
sent away, and let the steamer go to the bottom, if that
was to be her fate. Mr. Marline thinks I had better
send her to the nearest port, which would be Cadiz.”</p>

<p>“That would be a sensible way to dispose of her,”
interposed O’Hara, who was in favor of an independent
cruise.</p>

<p>“Then I find I differ from all others. I am neither
in favor of sending her to Cadiz, or of letting her go to
the bottom,” added the captain of the Tritonia decidedly.
“And, as I am to be responsible for my action,
I shall follow my own plan. Mr. Primback annoys me
very much, and I wish to put an end to this state of
things as soon as possible.”</p>

<p>“You did not state your plan, captain,” suggested
O’Hara nervously; for the independent cruise seemed
to be no longer probable.</p>

<p>“I worked over the dead reckoning last night, after
the calm settled down upon us; and I make it out that
the Josephine cannot be more than forty or fifty miles
to the southward of us. She must have laid her course
sooner than we did, or we should not have lost sight of
her in the night.”</p>

<p>“The American Prince must have sailed some time
in the evening, if she was not delayed by the storm;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
and she may have overhauled the Josephine before this
time.”</p>

<p>“Possibly; but the two vessels got so much off their
course during the blow, that I hardly expect to see the
Prince till we reach Funchal,” replied Capt. Wainwright.
“All I care for is to get the vice-principal on board
again; and then he can settle all disputed questions,
and order the Ville d’Angers to Funchal or to Cadiz,
as he pleases; and I shall be relieved of all responsibility.”</p>

<p>“I see,” said O’Hara; but he did not see what he
wished to see.</p>

<p>“The Josephine must be becalmed, as we are, within
fifty miles of us; and, as the weather is clear now, we
shall be likely to see her,” continued the captain. “So,
Mr. O’Hara, you will range your steamer ahead of the
Tritonia, and take on board our best hemp cable. In
other words, you will take the schooner in tow. When
you have made fast our line, you will make your course
south south-west, and run under full steam.”</p>

<p>“South south-west, under full steam,” repeated
O’Hara, not at all pleased with the prospect; for he
did not like the idea of having the Ville d’Angers
changed into a tow-boat, as he contemptuously expressed
it afterwards.</p>

<p>“It is now nearly eight bells in the morning,” continued
Wainwright. “You will take the course given
you; and if by meridian we don’t see any thing of the
Josephine, I shall be ready to give you new orders.”</p>

<p>O’Hara returned to his boat, and was pulled to the
steamer. She went on, and took a position ahead of
the schooner, and as near as it was safe to lie. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
second cutter carried the tow-line to her stern, and the
end was hauled on board. It was made fast under the
direction of Mr. Rimmer, for there were no proper bitts
for the purpose.</p>

<p>“Are you all ready?” shouted the captain of the
Tritonia.</p>

<p>“All ready, sir,” replied O’Hara, when the hawser
had been secured.</p>

<p>“Then go ahead,” responded Capt. Wainwright.</p>

<p>The bells in the engine-room sounded; and in a few
minutes the Ville d’Angers was going ahead at full
speed, towing the Tritonia in the direction indicated
by the captain of the latter.</p>

<p>Mr. Frisbone was informed of the use to be made of
the steamer; but he offered no objection. He had
heard that Madeira was a good place for invalids; and
very likely his wife’s sister would do as well as, if not better
than, at Malaga so late in the season. He was as
willing to go to Funchal as to Spain. He staid in the
fire-room till six o’clock, when he had thoroughly trained
both watches of firemen in their duties.</p>

<p>During the forenoon Tom Speers saw Miss Rodwood
for the first time since the stirring event of the early
morning. She expressed her gratitude to him in the
warmest terms, and Tom thought she was prettier than
ever.</p>

<p>“You bear a name which has been familiar to me
for some years, Miss Rodwood,” said Tom, trying to
turn the conversation from his own gallant deed.
“Judge Rodwood was my uncle’s most intimate friend,
but I have no acquaintance with his family; and possibly
you are his daughter.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>“I am not his daughter: he has no children. Judge
Rodwood is my uncle; and he is a very intimate friend
of Mr. Frisbone.”</p>

<p>“Yes; and he was very anxious to find you, young
man,” said the Prince, who joined the party in the
cabin at this moment.</p>

<p>“He was more anxious to find me than I was to have
him find me,” replied Tom, laughing.</p>

<p>“Your uncle has left you a big fortune, and appointed
the judge your guardian. Didn’t you get a
despatch and some letters from him?” asked the
Prince.</p>

<p>“I received a despatch and a letter from him,” replied
Tom.</p>

<p>“Then, why under the sun didn’t you answer it, or go
to London at once?” demanded the Prince, who supposed
he had not received any thing from the judge.</p>

<p>Tom honestly explained why he had not opened the
letter.</p>

<p>“If you have any influence with Judge Rodwood, I
hope you will use it to induce him to allow me to
remain in the academy squadron,” continued Tom.</p>

<p>“I certainly will; for I believe it is the best institution
in the world,” replied the Prince heartily.</p>

<p>“Sail on the starboard bow!” shouted the lookout
in the fore-top of the Tritonia, loudly enough to be
heard on board of the steamer.</p>

<p>This announcement put an end to the conversation,
for all were anxious to know whether or not the sail
was the Josephine. All the glasses on board were
pointed at the white spot on the ocean in the distance.
A gentle breeze was blowing from the south-east, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
the vessel had all sail set; but she was too far off for
the officers of the steamer to determine what she was.</p>

<p>“On board the Ville d’Angers!” shouted the officer
of the deck on the Tritonia.</p>

<p>Raymond answered the hail; and the order came
from Capt. Wainwright, to head the steamer to the
south-west. This course was directly towards the
distant sail. At six bells in the forenoon watch, all
hands were assured that the sail was the Josephine.
Wainwright ordered three guns to be fired on board of
the steamer, to attract the attention of her people; for
the wind was freshening, and the chase was likely to
be prolonged. Mr. Frisbone, who had fired the guns
which answered as signals of distress, attended to this
duty, though the students were very anxious to assist,
especially in pulling the lock-string.</p>

<p>The signals were heard on board of the Josephine;
and she came about, and stood towards the steamer and
her tow. In half an hour the vessels were within hailing
distance.</p>

<p>“Steamer ahoy!” shouted Robinson, the officer of
the deck on board of the Josephine.</p>

<p>“On board of the Josephine!” replied Raymond.</p>

<p>“What steamer is that?”</p>

<p>“The Ville d’Angers, towing the Tritonia.”</p>

<p>While this conversation was going on, the crew of
the Josephine were getting out the second cutter; and,
when it was lowered into the water, Mr. Pelham
stepped on board. The boat pulled for the Tritonia,
which had been cast off by the steamer, and had
heaved to under the lee of the Josephine. The vice-principal
boarded her, and was received by Capt.
Wainwright, cap in hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>“I am very glad to see you, Mr. Pelham,” said
Wainwright, as they shook hands.</p>

<p>“I did not expect to see the Tritonia again till she
arrived at Funchal,” replied the vice-principal.</p>

<p>“I am glad you have come, sir,” said Professor
Primback in a severe tone. “I am sorry to be obliged
to charge Wainwright with gross insubordination during
your absence, Mr. Pelham.”</p>

<p>“I will hear your complaint at another time, Mr.
Primback,” replied the vice-principal.</p>

<p>“I think it would be more proper to hear it at the
present time,” added the professor. “I have suspended
Wainwright and Scott from duty; and I wish to know
whether or not my authority is to be sustained. No
attention whatever has been paid to my directions. If
you have any orders to give, you will please regard
Greenwood as the captain, and Alexander as the first
lieutenant.”</p>

<p>The professor then retired to the cabin.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX.<br>

<small>THE NEW SHIP’S COMPANY.</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE vice-principal was very much perplexed at the
condition of things he found on board of the Tritonia.
He was greatly annoyed that his involuntary
absence had raised a tempest in the vessel. He was
astonished to find the schooner in tow of the steamer;
and, before he made any inquiries into the case of discipline,
he listened to the report of the captain of the
events which had transpired since the consorts parted
company.</p>

<p>Before Wainwright had proceeded far with his account,
the cutter which had conveyed Mr. Pelham on
board returned with Mr. Fluxion. The two vice-principals
heard the story, and then retired to the cabin to
consult together in regard to it. Mr. Primback was
called; and his charges against the captain and the
second lieutenant were heard.</p>

<p>Wainwright and Scott were questioned in the presence
of the professor; and, when they had retired, the
charge against Scott was declared to be frivolous, as
any sailor could see that it was.</p>

<p>“I think if you will read the regulations, Professor
Primback, you will see that you had no authority to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
suspend the captain or the second lieutenant,” said
Mr. Fluxion, who was disgusted with the conduct of
the instructor.</p>

<p>“I admit that the regulations give me no authority
over the officers of the vessel in purely nautical matters,”
replied Mr. Primback. “I take pride and pleasure
in acknowledging that I know nothing about a ship
or its management.”</p>

<p>“It would be better if you knew enough about nautical
matters to understand the duty of the officers,”
added the senior vice-principal. “It is very unpleasant
for me to decide against you; but the case is so
very plain, that I can’t do otherwise.”</p>

<p>“I think you have not fully examined the premises,
Mr. Fluxion,” continued the professor, nettled at the
obvious displeasure of the senior authority. “The
scholastic department is under my direction in the
absence of the junior vice-principal.”</p>

<p>“That is admitted.”</p>

<p>“But the captain, a mere boy, may send away one-half
of the students, and then require the other half to
be on duty all the time in the management of the
vessel. In other words, he may practically abolish the
scholastic department,” added Mr. Primback triumphantly,
for he believed he had made out a very strong
case.</p>

<p>“And the head of the scholastic department takes
pride in being so ignorant of nautical affairs as to be
incapable of judging whether or not the captain is justified
in sending away one-half of his ship’s company,
and requiring the other half to do duty on board of
his own vessel,” answered Mr. Fluxion, with some excitement
in his manner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>“Then, as the acting principal, I may be carted all
over the ocean at the pleasure of this boy!” exclaimed
the professor. “I may not even protest when he
chooses to depart from the course of any boyish enterprise
that happens to excite his imagination.”</p>

<p>“That is precisely the situation,” replied the senior
vice-principal, with a smile. “The boy will be held
responsible for the management of the vessel; and, if
he depart from the prescribed course without sufficient
reason for doing so, he would be punished for it. If
he took the vessel out upon such a boyish expedition
as you describe, he would certainly lose his place as
commander.”</p>

<p>“But the boy is placed over the man: I am ignored,
though I am old enough to be the boy’s father,” protested
the professor.</p>

<p>“The boy has no authority over you, any more than
you have over him, in nautical matters. The sailor is
placed over the landsman. But you forget, Mr. Primback,
that this is an exceptional case. The accidental
absence of the vice-principal in charge caused all the
difficulty. This is a thing that is not likely to happen
again. A sudden squall rendered it impossible for him
to return to his vessel.”</p>

<p>“Am I to understand that you approve the conduct
of this boy, sir?” demanded the professor.</p>

<p>“If he had obeyed your orders, he might have been
compelled to abandon Mr. Frisbone and the two ladies
to their fate, to say nothing of the duty of saving the
steamer. I do approve the conduct of Capt. Wainwright;
and I think he deserves nothing but praise and
commendation for what he has done. I am sure the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
principal will take the same view of the matter,” replied
Mr. Fluxion.</p>

<p>“Then I am to be snubbed by this boy?”</p>

<p>“I understand you to say that he has been courteous
and polite to you.”</p>

<p>“I have no fault to find with his manner; only with
his refusal to obey me.”</p>

<p>“Then I think nothing more need be said about the
matter. If you had confined yourself to your own
duties, there would have been no trouble.”</p>

<p>“I consider myself censured by your decision; and
I desire to resign my position as an instructor in this
institution,” added Mr. Primback, with all the dignity
he could assume.</p>

<p>“I have nothing to do with your resignation: that
should go to the principal,” replied Mr. Fluxion, who
hoped to see a more reasonable person in his place,
and one who knew a brace from a bobstay.</p>

<p>The professor disappeared in his state-room, and related
his grievances to Dr. Crumples, who had no sympathy
at all with him.</p>

<p>The more interesting question to be settled was the
destination of the Ville d’Angers. The vice-principals
talked it over for some time, without coming to a conclusion,
and then decided to visit the steamer to confer
with Mr. Frisbone. The Prince gave them a hearty
greeting; but he had no opinion in regard to the disposal
of the vessel. There was no law, so far as they
were aware, that required the vessel to be taken to one
port rather than another; and it was finally decided
that the voyage to Madeira should be continued, the
steamer accompanying the two schooners.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>But Mr. Fluxion was not satisfied with the present
arrangement in regard to the ship’s company of the
Ville d’Angers, since it was composed of one-half of
the Tritonia’s people, while the Josephine remained
fully manned. He thought the burden of taking the
steamer into port should be more equally divided between
the two vessels. Mr. Pelham doubted whether it
was expedient to mix the two crews; but his senior overruled
his objection, and a new list was made out for the
ship’s company of the extra vessel. The names were
shown to O’Hara by the vice-principals.</p>

<p>“I suppose you don’t object,” said Mr. Fluxion,
with a rather sarcastic smile; for he was not much inclined
to consult the wishes of the young gentlemen
when he detailed them for duty outside of their own
craft. “You will have more officers, and a larger
crew for the steamer.”</p>

<p>“Upon me sowl, I do object!” exclaimed O’Hara,
with no little excitement in his manner, after he had
looked at the list of officers.</p>

<p>“Well, what’s the matter now?” demanded the senior
vice-principal, with something like a frown on his
bronzed face.</p>

<p>“I like the ship’s company we have now a great dale
better,” replied O’Hara decidedly.</p>

<p>“It would be quite as respectful if you should pronounce
the English language properly when you address
your superior officers,” added Mr. Fluxion, who
was by far the severest disciplinarian in the squadron.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, sir,” said O’Hara, touching his
cap, and taking it off while he bowed low to the senior
officer present. “I did not intend to be disrespectful.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>“Very well, Mr. O’Hara: you have shown that you
can speak English as well as French, Italian, and
Irish,” replied Mr. Fluxion, his face relaxing into a
smile again. “What objection have you to the list in
your hand?”</p>

<p>“I like the present detail better, sir.”</p>

<p>“That is no answer to my question. What objection
have you?”</p>

<p>“The first is, that this reduces Mr. Speers to the
rank of second officer, when he has done all the hard
work of putting the steamer into sailing-trim as first.”</p>

<p>“If an officer from the Tritonia has the command,
the Josephine should have the second place on board,”
added Mr. Fluxion.</p>

<p>“I think that is quite fair,” interposed Mr. Pelham.</p>

<p>“I think so myself, if the Josephine is to take part
in getting the vessel into port,” continued O’Hara, who
could not help recognizing the fairness of the senior’s
decision. “But my second objection is to mixing the
two crews at all.”</p>

<p>“I see no objection to that,” said Mr. Fluxion.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid they won’t agree together,” suggested
O’Hara, shaking his head.</p>

<p>“If there is any danger of a disagreement of this
kind, it is time the two crews were mingled, so that
they may learn a new lesson in discipline.”</p>

<p>“There has always been a good deal of rivalry and
some hard feeling among the different vessels of the
squadron, sir,” continued O’Hara; and it is probable
that the boy knew more about this matter than the man,
and the junior vice-principal, who had been a student in
the institution, understood it better than the senior.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>“I can conceive of no disagreement among officers
and seamen while on duty. You are to be in command
of the steamer, Mr. O’Hara; and if any one from the
Josephine refuses to obey your orders, or makes trouble
on board, you will promptly report it to me; and, if the
offender is an officer, he shall take the lowest number
in the ship,” replied the stern disciplinarian, with the
feeling, that, if there were any such insubordination in
the vessel, he would like to get hold of it.</p>

<p>“But the vessels may be separated again, as they
have been before,” suggested O’Hara, who was certainly
very much opposed to having any of the Josephine’s
officers under his command.</p>

<p>“We are not likely to be separated again: we have
had one hard storm, and we are not in much danger of
having another before we get to Madeira, which will be
in three or four days at the most.”</p>

<p>“I will do the best I can, sir,” replied O’Hara,
touching his cap to the senior.</p>

<p>“I don’t like to have the students serve as firemen,”
continued Mr. Fluxion. “Possibly I may be able to
find a crew of firemen for the steamer.”</p>

<p>“How will it be possible for you to find a crew of
firemen here in mid-ocean?” asked Mr. Pelham, smiling
with incredulity.</p>

<p>“The Josephine has not been without an adventure
any more than the Tritonia,” replied Mr. Fluxion.
“Yesterday morning at daylight we picked up a boat in
which were six men. They are all Frenchmen and Italians;
and say their steamer was sunk in a collision with
another vessel in the night. Most of the crew and passengers
got on board of the other vessel, and they took<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
a boat to go to her; but it was upset in the heavy sea.
They righted the boat, and all but one of them succeeded
in getting into it again; but the other vessel was out
of sight in the fog then, and they were unable to find
her. This is the story they tell; and I have no doubt
it is true. Very likely they belonged to the Ville d’Angers.”</p>

<p>“If they did, how was it possible for you to have
picked them up?” asked Mr. Pelham.</p>

<p>“The steamer could not have been a great way from
either of us when you heard the guns, though the Tritonia,
as we may see by comparing the reckoning, was
considerably to the northward of the Josephine,” added
Mr. Fluxion.</p>

<p>“But where are these men? They have recognized
the steamer by this time, if she was the one in which
they were employed.”</p>

<p>“Probably they have not seen her yet,” replied Mr.
Fluxion, laughing. “They slept all day yesterday;
and, as I did not see them on deck when I left the
schooner, I suppose they are sleeping off another day.
They asked for wine, and insisted that they must have
it; and they have slept all the time since I told them
we had none on board.”</p>

<p>The change was announced to the ship’s company
of the Ville d’Angers; and the half-dozen students who
were required to return to the Tritonia were indignant
and dissatisfied; but none of them dared say any thing
in the presence of Mr. Fluxion. They were ordered
into the Josephine’s boat, and left on board of their
own vessel. The cutter then proceeded to the Josephine,
and both vice-principals boarded her. O’Hara
went with them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>It was found that the men picked up in the boat
were still asleep under the top-gallant forecastle, where
quarters had been fixed up for them. Mr. Shakings,
the adult boatswain of the Josephine, was directed to
call them; and they soon presented themselves in the
waist, where the vice-principals were waiting to examine
them in regard to their vessel. They were a very hard-looking
set of men; and it was evident enough that
severe discipline would be required to keep them in
order.</p>

<p>As soon as they came on deck, they discovered the
Ville d’Angers, which lay astern of the Josephine.
They threw up their hands in astonishment when they
saw her, and uttered a great many wild exclamations.</p>

<p>“What was the name of your steamer?” asked Mr.
Fluxion in French.</p>

<p>“The Ville d’Angers,” replied one of them; and
then they all indulged in another volley of exclamations.</p>

<p>“Is that the Ville d’Angers?” inquired the senior,
pointing at the steamer.</p>

<p>“It is not possible!” shouted several of them at
once. “She was sunk. A big hole was cut in her
bow; and the water was pouring into her when we left
her.”</p>

<p>They all talked together, and it was almost impossible
to understand them. Some spoke in French, and others
in Italian; for it appeared that there was a scarcity of
Frenchmen, so many of them had gone into the army.
The most intelligent one was an Italian; and he was
conducted to the quarter-deck, where O’Hara was instructed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
to question him. But all the information
needed had been obtained from Mr. Frisbone.</p>

<p>This man said his name was Alfonzo. He was
asked if he and his companions were willing to work
as firemen of the steamer on the trip to Funchal, if
they received good wages. Then the fellow put on a
cunning look, and it was plain that he was disposed to
drive a sharp bargain. He thought a moment; and
the interpreter saw that he was studying up some hard
terms, and was going to ask for something which he
regarded as exorbitant.</p>

<p>“We worked on the Ville d’Angers six days for
which we have received no pay,” said Alfonzo, with a
cunning leer on his face. “Pay us for this time, and
we will work on the steamer.”</p>

<p>“What were your wages on the steamer?” asked
O’Hara.</p>

<p>The fellow hesitated a moment, and then said three
francs a day. O’Hara reported the substance of Alfonzo’s
reply to the senior, at the same time expressing
his belief that the Italian was lying, and that the
firemen—for such they all were—had not been paid
more than two francs, or at most not more than two
and a half.</p>

<p>“Sixty cents a day is little enough for men who work
in the fire-room of a ship at sea; and they shall have
their own price,” replied Mr. Fluxion.</p>

<p>O’Hara informed Alfonzo that his terms were acceded
to, and he was told to settle the matter with his
companions. He looked quite sad, instead of rejoicing
that his terms had been accepted: he was sorry
that he had not asked more. The others assented.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>“This young gentleman is the captain of the steamer,”
said Mr. Fluxion, pointing to O’Hara.</p>

<p>The firemen all laughed as they surveyed him from
head to foot; and possibly they thought they should
have an easy time of it on board of the Ville d’Angers,
if she was to be managed by boys like those of
the Tritonia. They were ordered into the boat, and
were put on board of the steamer.</p>

<p>“Mr. Speers particularly desires that the studies
may be continued while we are on board of the steamer,”
said O’Hara, when the men had been sent away.</p>

<p>“Speers!” exclaimed the senior vice-principal, evidently
astonished at the suggestion. “He is the young
man who went from the steerage up to first master, and
whose guardian is looking for him, I believe.”</p>

<p>“The same, sir.”</p>

<p>“He shall be gratified; and Capt. Fairfield, our
extra instructor, who is the most versatile scholar in
the squadron, shall be transferred to the Ville d’Angers,”
added Mr. Fluxion.</p>

<p>“Capt. Fairfield!” exclaimed O’Hara, afraid the
instructor might be a sailor, and be placed over his
head as an acting vice-principal; for, like most young
men, he preferred to have the supreme command of the
vessel.</p>

<p>“He is a West-Pointer, and knows no more about a
ship than a marine; though he is perfect in the theory
of navigation,” Mr. Fluxion explained. “You will
divide your authority with no one, Mr. O’Hara. I
shall send boatswain Shakings of this vessel with you
to look out for your rigging.”</p>

<p>“What are my orders in case the vessels should be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
separated?” asked the young commander of the Ville
d’Angers, though he was a year older than a young
man we knew who had the full command of a thousand-ton
ship; or another who brought his bark safely
into port through the worst storm of the season.</p>

<p>“I suppose you would prefer to have your steamer
separated from the rest of the squadron,” added Mr.
Fluxion, laughing.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, sir; but I might have run for
any port in the world when I had the steamer all to
myself: but, instead of that, I went to look for the
Tritonia,” replied the captain, a little hurt by the remark
of the senior.</p>

<p>“You did exceedingly well, Capt. O’Hara; and I
may add that I have full confidence in you. I know of
no officer in the squadron whom I should prefer for
the service to which Capt. Wainwright first appointed
you; and I commend him for the good judgment he
exercised in his selection. I only wonder that he did
not appoint Scott, who is a prime favorite of his.”</p>

<p>“I thank you, sir,” replied O’Hara, touching his cap.
“But Mr. Scott is a good officer, sir.”</p>

<p>“As good as any in the squadron, but not the best
for an independent command,” added the senior.</p>

<p>By this time the cutter had returned; and the Josephine’s
portion of the crew of the Ville d’Angers
were sent on board. The Tritonia’s part were already
on duty. As soon as the boat was hoisted up at the
davits, the two schooners filled away. A six-knot
breeze was blowing, and they were soon at a considerable
distance from the steamer; for O’Hara had been
instructed to station his ship’s company under the new
arrangement before he got under way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>He immediately called all hands, now consisting of
six officers and twenty-four seamen beside himself. As
he had twelve hands in each watch, he divided each
into quarter-watches. He appointed four quartermasters,
who were to have charge of the wheel under the
officer of the deck, and a few petty officers for other
duties. The state-rooms were assigned to the students;
and the regulations of the academy squadron declared
to be in full force on board, so far as they were applicable.</p>

<p>“It is now four bells in the afternoon watch; and
the second part of the starboard watch has the deck,”
said Capt. O’Hara, when all the arrangements had been
completed. “The officers and seamen will take their
stations.”</p>

<p>Raymond was the officer of the second part of the
watch indicated; and he repaired to the pilot-house to
assume his duties. The quartermaster of the second
part was there, with a seaman to assist at the wheel.</p>

<p>“I don’t like this arrangement,” said Gregory, the
first officer, who had been fourth lieutenant of the
Josephine, as he followed the captain forward.</p>

<p>“I am sorry you don’t, Mr. Gregory,” replied
O’Hara, rather coldly.</p>

<p>“I don’t think there is any need of quarter-watches
in this steamer,” added the first officer, with more
emphasis than before.</p>

<p>“I don’t think so either,” chimed in Clinch, the third
master of the Josephine.</p>

<p>“That shows that we differ in opinion a little taste,”
returned O’Hara with a smile. “You may start her
now, Mr. Raymond,” continued the captain, when he
came to the pilot-house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>“Start her, sir,” repeated Raymond. “One bell,
quartermaster.”</p>

<p>“One bell, sir,” returned the quartermaster, as he
pulled the handle on the wheel-frame.</p>

<p>The screw began to turn slowly, and the Ville
d’Angers went ahead. A few minutes later the speed-bell
was rung, and the steamer increased her rate to
something like ten knots an hour, though she was
capable of making twelve or more. But a thick fog
had settled down upon the ocean, and nothing could be
seen of the rest of the little fleet. The captain ordered
the regular fog-signal to be sounded at intervals, and
a sharp lookout to be kept for the other vessels.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X.<br>

<small>SOMETHING ABOUT THE MADEIRA ISLANDS.</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">ON board of the Josephine and the Tritonia, the
number sent away rendered it necessary to re-organize
the watches. While the vice-principals were
attending to this duty, the wind suddenly changed, so
that the vessels could not lay their course; and it had
headed them off till they were standing nearly to the
southward. At the same time the fog shut out the
Ville d’Angers from view. For a time after the course
had been changed, the fog-signals of the steamer were
heard; and then they ceased.</p>

<p>As the steamer was not disturbed by the change of
wind, Mr. Fluxion feared she would run ahead of the
little squadron, and lose sight of her associates. He
directed the captain to tack after the Josephine had
run some five miles to the southward, so as to keep
somewhere on the track of the steamer. The fog was
very deep and dense, and he wondered that the Ville
had ceased to whistle. He was not prepared to believe
that the captain of the steamer would wilfully run
away from her consorts; and the situation puzzled him.
The Tritonia was near enough to hear the signals of
the other schooner; and there was little danger of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
losing sight of each other unless heavy weather came
on, of which there were some indications.</p>

<p>The captains had consulted their barometers as soon
as the watches had been re-arranged. Wainwright was
astonished to observe a considerable fall of the instrument;
and he immediately reported the fact to Mr.
Pelham, and Capt. Vroome did the same to Mr.
Fluxion. Every preparation was at once made for
heavy weather; and they had it before dark.</p>

<p>While the fog was still hanging over the ocean, the
wind began to come in heavy gusts, and all the light
sails were hastily taken in. Just after dark the fog
lifted, or was driven to seaward by the strong breeze.
The vice-principals looked anxiously for the lights of
the Ville d’Angers; but nothing could be seen of them
in any direction. During the night the wind blew a
fierce gale from the southward. At daylight the gale
had moderated, but the fog settled down on the water
again. Nothing was seen or heard of the steamer.
For three days more, in all sorts of weather, though
the wind was generally contrary, the schooners continued
on their course, and then arrived safely at
Funchal.</p>

<p>“There is the Prince at anchor off the Loo Rock!”
exclaimed Mr. Pelham, as the Tritonia approached the
town of Funchal.</p>

<p>“That’s an odd-looking rock,” added Scott, who
heard the remark. “It looks like the head of the sea-serpent,
with a fort built on the top of his cranium.”</p>

<p>“That fort commands the harbor, if we can call this
a harbor when it has no shelter from any storm from
the east or south, where most of the tempests of this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
region come from,” continued the vice-principal, who
had been at these islands before. “The rock is
seventy feet high; and the Portuguese have made it
impossible to climb up its steep sides, except by the
steps opposite the island. The top of it is three hundred
feet long by a hundred wide; and this space is
covered by a fort, mounting fourteen guns, which is
always kept garrisoned, as a sort of regulator of the
vessels in the roadstead. If they don’t obey orders,
and follow the rules of the port, a gun from that fort
will remind them of the neglect; and any attempt to
evade them will bring a shot.”</p>

<p>“There is a mole, or something of that kind,” added
Scott, who was off duty, and was privileged to observe
the wonders of the shore.</p>

<p>“That is the Pontinha. It is a sort of breakwater,
though it affords no great protection to vessels, which
are sometimes obliged to get up their anchors, and
work out to sea, to avoid being cast upon the rocks.
It is an embankment built out to a small island on
which is the fort of San José. You see that the vessels
behind the Loo Rock are moored in a line. They
are made fast to heavy cables, secured by iron bolts
to the rock at the bow, while a stern line is carried to
the shore of the main island. The bottom is very
rocky, and the holding ground is not good.”</p>

<p>All hands were called to be ready to moor ship; but
even this was not allowable until the health officers
had visited the schooners, and a government boat had
been alongside. When these formalities were all completed,
the two vessels hauled in beside the American
Prince, and were moored like the other craft.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>As soon as the rules of the port would permit it,—for
no vessel can communicate with the shore, or with
another vessel, until the proper permits are obtained,—the
vice-principals went on board of the Prince to
report to the principal, who of course had no intimation
of the stirring events which had transpired on the
passage from Gibraltar. The boat’s crew that pulled
them to the steamer boarded the Prince; and the students
told the story of the Ville d’Angers, though the
Princes had nothing of interest to relate in return, for
the ship had not sailed till the violence of the storm
had abated, and had made a tolerably comfortable
voyage.</p>

<p>The Princes thought the fellows in the picked-up
steamer were having a jolly time of it; and most of
them were willing to believe they had taken it into
their heads to go off on a cruise by themselves, and
would return when they got ready. Scott defended
O’Hara from the implied charges against him, and was
confident the Ville d’Angers would soon arrive.</p>

<p>“It will be a big lark for those fellows,” insisted
McLane, the fourth lieutenant of the Prince.</p>

<p>“It’s no lark at all, Mack,” replied Scott. “O’Hara
is a countryman of yours, and you judge him by yourself.”</p>

<p>“That’s so!” exclaimed McLane. “If I had the
command of a fine steamer like the Ville d’Angers, I
don’t think I should hurry to get into port with
her.”</p>

<p>“That will do for you, but not for O’Hara. When
he gets out to sea he knows the way back,” added
Scott.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>“You won’t see that steamer for a week at the least,”
persisted McLane.</p>

<p>“I can’t say that we shall; but, if we don’t, it will
not be for any fault of O’Hara.”</p>

<p>“If it were my case, I would take the steamer to
New York, stopping at the ‘Isles of the Sea’ on the
way, making sure that I kept out of the way of the
academy squadron all the time,” continued the lieutenant
of the Prince.</p>

<p>“It’s easy enough for you to tell what you would do,
Mack; but the principal knows you well enough not to
trust you with a mud-scow, to say nothing of a fine
steamer like the Ville d’Angers.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you think I could handle a steamer as well
as O’Hara?” demanded the Prince, a little nettled by
the raillery of the Tritonia.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you could; but you couldn’t find your way
to the port named in your orders, according to your
own confession.”</p>

<p>“Well, O’Hara hasn’t done it yet.”</p>

<p>“But he will do it, unless there is some good reason
to prevent him from doing so.”</p>

<p>This sort of banter continued till the vice-principals
came out of the main cabin with Mr. Lowington. The
principal of the squadron had listened with the deepest
interest to the narration of the subordinate officials.
When he was informed that thirty-one of the students
were on board of the steamer, on their way to the
Madeiras, or roaming at their own pleasure over the
ocean, he looked very anxious and troubled. The fact
that Mr. Frisbone was with them afforded him some
relief.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>“I am rather sorry that one of you had not gone
with them,” added he, fixing his gaze upon the cabin
floor.</p>

<p>“Possibly one of us might, if our experience on the
day we sailed from Gibraltar had not taught us better,”
replied Mr. Fluxion; who, as the senior vice-principal,
was responsible for all that had been done after the
Ville d’Angers overhauled the Josephine. “I thought
Mr. Pelham was very indiscreet to leave his vessel,
even to board mine on business, and I was not disposed
to have the mistake repeated.”</p>

<p>This statement brought in the earlier history of the
eventful cruise, and the junior vice-principal delivered
the letter from Judge Rodwood to the principal. He
read it, and then listened to the account of Tom Speers’s
running away from the fortune in store for him.</p>

<p>“The judge can have Speers as soon as he wants
him,” added Mr. Lowington. “A student with three
millions behind him, and a letter of credit for four thousand
dollars in his pocket, is a nuisance.”</p>

<p>“I think not, sir, in this case,” interposed Mr. Pelham.
“Speers is a very ambitious young man: he
jumped from the steerage to first master of the Tritonia
and contrived to avoid going to London to meet Judge
Rodwood because he was not willing to leave the
vessel. He desires to finish his course; and there is
not a better sailor or a more faithful student in the
squadron.”</p>

<p>“I am glad to hear you speak so well of him; but
this letter contains a request that he be discharged
from the academy, and be sent to London. I am asked
to telegraph that he is on his way.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>“It is too late to do any thing of that kind now,”
added Mr. Pelham. “Speers did not open the letter
which enclosed this one till the Tritonia was at sea;
and he did not open the telegraph despatch for the
reason that he did not believe it was for him.”</p>

<p>“He has managed it very well. This letter contains
a request from his former and from his present guardian;
but the young man is not here, and I cannot
discharge him. Should I do so, it is not probable that
he would find his guardian in London if I sent him
there: I shall therefore do nothing till I receive further
instructions,” continued the principal. “But this is a
matter of little consequence compared with the cruise
of this French steamer.”</p>

<p>Again the principal inquired into all the circumstances
of the parting of the vessels in the fog. Both
of the vice-principals assured him that the captain of
the Ville d’Angers was an entirely reliable student in
every respect, and that he was too high-toned to go off
on an independent cruise.</p>

<p>“I supposed the steamer had got in ahead of us
while we were standing to the southward, and that we
should find her in Funchal on our arrival,” explained
Mr. Fluxion.</p>

<p>“If that were the case, she ought to have been here
yesterday,” replied the principal. “What do you suppose
can have detained her?”</p>

<p>“I can imagine a dozen circumstances which may
have delayed her, and none of them may be the proper
explanation,” answered the senior vice-principal.
“There was a smart gale in the night, after we parted;
but I can hardly conceive of such a thing as the Ville<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
d’Angers, which was a nearly new vessel, and seaworthy
in every respect, foundering in such a light
storm. She may have broken her shaft, or deranged
her machinery.”</p>

<p>“That would compel her to come in under sail,”
suggested the principal.</p>

<p>“She is well found in every respect; for I directed
Shakings to overhaul her, and report to me. But it
may take her two or three days longer than it has the
schooners to get here. The officers may have had
trouble with the foreign firemen, for I think they were
a desperate set of villains. But Mr. Frisbone, Shakings,
Rimmer, the cook, and two stewards, make six
full-grown men; and some of the students are about
equal to able-bodied men: so that, if there has been a
fight on board, I am confident our side has got the best
of it,” continued Mr. Fluxion, who was a muscular
Christian, and rather enjoyed the idea of reducing the
firemen to a proper state of subjection if they attempted
to put on airs.</p>

<p>“Raymond, the fourth officer, is as brave a fellow
as ever trod a deck; and I will match him against any
two of those firemen,” added Mr. Pelham, who also
had some taste for a fight in a good cause.</p>

<p>“I sincerely hope that nothing of the kind has
occurred on board of the steamer,” said Mr. Lowington,
who was thoroughly a man of peace, and justified
no fighting that could possibly be avoided.</p>

<p>“I don’t think any thing of the kind has occurred,
and I mentioned it only as a possibility. It is more
probable that some derangement of the machinery of
the vessel had delayed her; and I shall expect her to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
come into port within two or three days,” continued
Mr. Fluxion. “In the mean time, the students on
board are pursuing their studies, so that there will be
no time lost.”</p>

<p>The vice-principals returned to their respective vessels;
but the principal could not help being very anxious
for the safety of the thirty-one students on board
of the Ville d’Angers. Possibly he was not so confident
as his junior officers that the young men had not gone
“on a lark” in the vessel. While this conversation
was going on, the signal, “All hands attend lecture,”
had been displayed on board of the steamer. All the
boats were in the water, and the students were soon
assembled in the American Prince. As usual, there
was a large map of the country to be described, hung
where all the pupils could see it. In this instance it
was a map of the Madeira Islands, drawn on a large
scale by the professor himself. Mr. Mapps stood by
it with a long pointer in his hand, when the students
took their places.</p>

<p>“The Madeiras are a group of five islands,” the
professor began, flourishing the pointer over the map
to attract the attention of his audience. “They are
some six hundred miles from Lisbon, four hundred
from the nearest part of the African coast, and five
hundred from the nearest of the Azores. The principal
island is called Madeira, from which Porto Santo,
the only other island of any importance, is only thirty-five
miles distant. The other three islands are called
the Desertas: they are merely uninhabited rocks.</p>

<p>“Madeira and Porto Santo contain an area of three
hundred and seventeen square miles, which is equal to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
about one-fourth of the State of Rhode Island; and
contain a population of one hundred and sixteen thousand
inhabitants, or about half that of the same State.</p>

<p>“Both of the inhabited islands are mountainous in
their structure, and are mostly bordered by steep cliffs
on the sea. Soundings are obtained by the ordinary
deep-sea lead only close to the shore; and even there
the water is over two hundred feet deep. Though the
island is of volcanic origin, only one crater is to be
found in the mountains. The greatest elevation is
about six thousand feet.</p>

<p>“Funchal is the principal town, and has about twenty
thousand inhabitants. Its principal business is in
wine and fruit. In later years the vine has failed to a
great extent, and the commerce of the island has been
greatly reduced. Many of the inhabitants are in a
state of destitution; and beggars are more common
here than in most of the countries of Europe.</p>

<p>“These islands, as well as the Western, or Azores,
are dependencies of the kingdom of Portugal. They
are represented in the legislature of that country, and
have, besides, a local government of their own. The
currency of the islands is the same as that of Portugal;
and you will find here most of the manners and customs
of that country. Possibly some of you will think
you have been here before. The city, like Messina in
Sicily, which you will remember, is built on a small
plain, watered by three little streams that rise in the
interior of the island, or on the surrounding hills.
Indeed, the island is very like Sicily.</p>

<p>“One of the great natural curiosities of Madeira is
the Coural, or Curral, as different writers call it. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
is an immense chasm, with perpendicular sides, thirteen
hundred feet deep. It is near the middle of the island;
and, if the time permits, I believe you will take a walk
to it; for there are no carriages in the country, or any
roads that are practicable for them. People who can
not or will not walk have to be transported by manpower.
In some parts they slide down the steep hills
on sleds, as boys coast on the snow at home. The
roads most travelled are paved with cobble-stones, or
the heavy rains would wash them entirely away; and
they are thus made the smoother for the sleds. A
kind of sled, called a ‘buey cart,’ drawn by oxen, is
also used to some extent. A hammock swung on a
long pole, the ends of which are borne on the shoulders
of two men, would seem to be the most natural conveyance
for a sailor.</p>

<p>“You will have an opportunity to see the country
and the city for yourselves, and I will not describe
them to you. The people are very gentlemanly and
polite, though I believe they are no more given to hard
work than the natives of the mother country. The
island is a great resort for invalids, especially those
with pulmonary complaints; and the same is true of
the Azores. The average temperature is sixty-four
degrees. A hot south-west wind, which comes over
from the great desert of Africa, sometimes carries the
mercury up to eighty degrees, though the heat in summer
rarely exceeds seventy. But the quality of the
climate depends upon the uniformity of its temperature.
There are no sudden changes; and one month
will not differ from the one before more than two or
three degrees. But Dr. Winstock, who spent a winter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
in the island, informs me that he has seen some very
disagreeable weather here.”</p>

<p>Professor Mapps finished his brief lecture, leaving
much to be learned by the students in their walks about
the city and the island. The boats of the Tritonia and
Josephine returned; and what was left of the day was
used by the officers and seamen in looking at the
strange sights that might be seen from the decks of the
vessels.</p>

<p>As the squadron was to remain some days at Funchal,
study and recitations were not entirely suspended;
but, as both watches could be engaged at the same
time, the full routine was completed at one o’clock, and
the rest of the day was improved on shore. Dr. Winstock
took under his care for the excursion, Sheridan
and Murray of the Prince, and Wainwright and Scott
of the Tritonia.</p>

<p>“This is a rough harbor for a commercial town,”
said Capt. Sheridan, as he landed from the boat, and
looked back to survey the beach, on which the sea was
breaking with considerable force.</p>

<p>“It is a very poor harbor,” replied the doctor.
“Sometimes the sea is so high in the roadstead, that it
is not safe for vessels to lie at anchor; and a government
boat goes to them, and advises them to get to
sea.”</p>

<p>“What sort of a boat do you call that?” asked Scott,
as he pointed to a very handsome barge near the shore.
“The sailors have coalhods, with marline spikes sticking
out of the tops.”</p>

<p>“That is a government boat, as you may see by the
uniform of the officers in it. The cap of the boatmen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
looks something like an inverted tunnel. But they
have a nice time of it under that awning.”</p>

<p>The doctor’s party by his advice had decided to use
their first half-day on shore in making a visit to the
church of “Nossa Senhora do Monte,” or “Our Lady of
the Mountain,” which is located on a hill nearly two
thousand feet above the sea. The place affords a
beautiful view of Funchal and its surroundings. It was
an up-hill walk; but most of the ascent was gradual,
though a portion of it was very steep. On the way
they had an opportunity to see some of the modes of
conveyance mentioned by the professor of geography
and history.</p>

<p>“It don’t seem to me that I should feel very comfortable
to have men carrying me about the island,”
said Murray, as he stopped to see one of the hammocks,
which was not unlike a palanquin. “I should
feel as though I were a burden upon my own kind.”</p>

<p>“They have very good horses here, though they are
rather small,—about the size of those they use for the
ascent of Mount Vesuvius.”</p>

<p>At last the church was reached after a most fatiguing
tramp, for the students had not got on their land legs.
Most of the way, the road, paved with cobble-stones,
was enclosed by a wall over which none of the party
were tall enough to see; and this made the walk dismal
at times, though they always had a view when looking
behind them. But this wall was covered with
vines; and, as it was springtime, the air was laden with
the perfume of flowers.</p>

<p>There is nothing about the church worth seeing; and
the business of the day was concluded by ascending<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
one of the two towers that crown the building, where
the party remained till sunset. The church faces the
sea; and from the elevated tower a panorama of a portion
of the city and a great deal of magnificent scenery
was spread out before the observers; and they returned
to their vessels delighted with the excursion.</p>

<p>Mr. Lowington was pacing the quarter-deck of the
Prince when the students returned; and it was observed
that he cast frequent glances to seaward in search of
the missing steamer, but she did not put in an appearance
in the offing that night.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI.<br>

<small>BUDDING VINES AND ORANGE-GROVES.</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE night passed away, and the morning, and the
Ville d’Angers did not appear off the island.
The principal had a long and anxious conference with
Mr. Fluxion. There was only one thing it was possible
to do, and that was to send the Prince in search of the
missing steamer; but it was decided to wait a day or
two longer before this was done.</p>

<p>The next afternoon the doctor and his little party
landed in the city, and began to explore the place.
After months of constant sight-seeing, they found little
in the way of public buildings, squares, or streets, to
engage their attention, and were more inclined to get
out into the country among the budding flowers and
orange-groves.</p>

<p>“That’s one of the carts we read of,” said Scott,
laughing, as he stopped to view a sort of sled on which
a yoke of small oxen were hauling a pipe of wine.</p>

<p>“It is one of the kind we see in Funchal, and elsewhere
in the island,” replied the doctor. “Wheels are
not practicable among these hills; and I am not sure
that this thing pulls any harder than the car with the
revolving axle which we saw in Portugal.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>“It certainly does not make any more music,” added
Murray, referring to the hideous screeching of the cart
they had seen in Lisbon.</p>

<p>The sled was something like a “stone-drag” used in
the New England States. It was a plank eight feet
long and a foot and a half wide, hollowed in the middle
so that a wine-cask will fit into it. It was four inches
thick, and pointed off at the bow like a boat. Under
it were two wooden runners. While the students were
looking at it, and while the driver was still yelling with
all his might at his diminutive cattle, a boy threw a sort
of mop made of rope-yarns, which he had just dipped
into a puddle of water, under the forward end of the
sled. The runners passed over it, wetting the bottoms,
thus making them run a little easier, and removing the
danger of fire from friction.</p>

<p>“This is the Praca Constitucional, a very common
name for a square in Spain and Portugal. It was
formerly the ‘Praca da Rainha,’ or Queen Square;
but the Constitution is more popular than the Queen.”</p>

<p>From the square the party passed into the market-place
adjoining it. Provisions, vegetables, fruit, provender
for horses, and wood were the articles on sale.
It was just such a sight as they had seen in Lisbon,
and the venders were yelling their wares vigorously
when any one that looked like a buyer came in sight.
One man had a pole on his shoulder, on which were
hung by the legs a dozen pairs of chickens, all alive,
and kicking to the extent of their ability. Another had
pigeons; but he had considerately killed them before
he suspended them on the pole. The one who drove a
single pig had about the same luck with him as any
other attempting this difficult feat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>“Drive him the other way!” shouted Scott to the
Portuguese, pointing behind the driver.</p>

<p>“He don’t understand you,” interposed the doctor,
translating the remark into Portuguese.</p>

<p>The man laughed as though he had heard the joke
before; but he did not adopt the suggestion.</p>

<p>“What’s the use of that brush they have tied up in
bundles?” asked Sheridan, as they paused before a
vender of this sort of merchandise.</p>

<p>“The bakers and others use it to heat their ovens,”
replied Dr. Winstock. “Wood is a very scarce article
in Madeira, though the name of the island in Portuguese
means ‘wood.’ There is little or no need of fuel
here, except for cooking purposes. Those bundles of
little sticks are not much better than the fagots. All
the coal has to be brought from other countries; and
that makes it very expensive. The wealthier people
and the boarding-houses use it.”</p>

<p>“Boarding the invalids that come here must be a
great business among the people,” said Wainwright, as
they passed a group of pale consumptives, seated in
the sun on the Praca.</p>

<p>“It is a very important item of the business of the
island.”</p>

<p>“Do you think it does them any good to come
here?” asked Scott.</p>

<p>“Undoubtedly it does; though, if you visit the cemeteries,
you will find a great many English and American
names on the gravestones. The great difficulty is
that those troubled with pulmonary diseases come when
it is too late for the climate to benefit them.”</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Lieutenant Scott’s Adventure.</span> Page <a href="#Page_153">153</a>.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The party passed into the principal street of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>town, which was not more than twenty-five feet wide,
and it was a broad thoroughfare for Funchal.</p>

<p>“Every gentleman seems to be acquainted with every
lady he meets,” said Sheridan, as they made their way
through the crowded street.</p>

<p>“That remark applies only to the native gentlemen;
and it is the custom for them to lift their hats to every
lady they meet,” replied the surgeon.</p>

<p>“I suppose that is done to make business for the
hatters,” added Scott.</p>

<p>“No: the Portuguese are even more polite than the
French, so far as these outward expressions are concerned;
but I doubt whether either would do as much
for a lady who really needed assistance as Americans
or Englishmen,” continued the doctor. “I can’t say
that I like to see gentlemen bowing to ladies who are
entire strangers to them. It is making themselves altogether
too familiar, though the custom of the country
may justify almost any thing.”</p>

<p>“This looks like Spain,” said Wainwright, pointing
to a lot of men from the country, who were driving three
or four donkeys each, loaded with skins filled with
wine. “They leave the legs of the goats on for
handles.”</p>

<p>“Those sacks look something like a goat,” added
Murray. “I wonder how they can sew them up tight
enough to prevent them from leaking.”</p>

<p>“They can roll the edges of the skins together a little
when they join them, and sew through four thicknesses
of the skin,” replied the doctor.</p>

<p>“Is that Madeira wine in those sacks?” inquired
Murray.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>“Probably not; for that is a scarce article, even in
this island, at the present time. Porto Santo, or Holy
Port, was the first island discovered and settled. Columbus
lived there for a time; and his house is still shown.
He married his wife there. The discovery and settlement
of Madeira followed soon after; and two years
later the Portuguese brought from Candia or Crete a
vine which proved to be admirably adapted to the climate.
The wine made from it became celebrated all
over the civilized world. Like port and sherry, it obtained
its peculiar flavor from the kind of grape of
which it was made. Ten years ago, owing to the failure
of the vine-crop, there were only four hundred
pipes of it remaining in the island, while twenty-five
thousand pipes had once been the average quantity
manufactured in a year. The disease attacked the
vine nearly twenty years ago; but the people are doing
their best to replace it, and doubtless the commerce
and reputation of the island will be fully restored.
Probably the greater portion of all the wine sold for
Madeira is not such; and not a little of it is manufactured
in the shops where it is sold, in England and
America.”</p>

<p>The party passed through the town, and went out
into the country on the west side; and, following the
road up the hill, they reached the summit of the “Pico
de Sao Joao,” on which was a fort. From this high
point they obtained another view of the city and its
suburbs. Beyond the town the shore of the island was
composed of sheer precipices, hundreds of feet in
height. Near them was a “quinta,” or country-house,
of some wealthy islander, to which a beautiful garden<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
was attached. As they passed the main gate of the
grounds, a gentleman attending a very pretty young
lady came out. Dr. Winstock raised his cap to him,
and the young officers followed his example.</p>

<p>The owner of the “quinta” politely returned the
salutation, and spoke to the surgeon in English; for
many of the educated people of the island speak this
language, and most of the foreign commerce is carried
on with England. Two saddle-horses were standing at
the gate, in charge of as many servants; but the gentleman
and his daughter—for such was the relation
between them—seemed to be in no haste to mount
their puny steeds.</p>

<p>“You are English people, I see,” said he, with a
pleasant smile. “My house and grounds are at your
service. This is the quinta da Sao Joao.”</p>

<p>“I thank you heartily for your courteous invitation;
but perhaps you may be disposed to withdraw it when
I add that we are not English, but Americans,” replied
Dr. Winstock.</p>

<p>“By no means!” exclaimed the gentleman, whom
they afterwards heard addressed as Don Roderigue.
“I repeat it with even more earnestness than before.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir; and we shall be very happy to
avail ourselves of your permission to visit your gardens.”</p>

<p>“You are all officers, I see,” continued Don Roderigue,
who evidently had some Yankee curiosity.</p>

<p>“In one sense we are: we are all connected with the
academy squadron, now moored in the port of Funchal.”</p>

<p>The Portuguese had never heard of it; and the surgeon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
briefly explained it, and invited Don Roderigue
to visit the ships of the squadron. He promised to do
so, and he and the young lady proceeded to mount
their horses. The father was safely seated on his little
steed, and the groom was assisting the daughter to the
saddle, when the little brute suddenly whirled about
like a top, and started off at a dead run. Dona
Maria’s foot had not been fairly placed in the stirrup,
nor had she taken the reins into her hands; so that
she was almost helpless.</p>

<p>The two grooms started after the little horse; but,
the faster they ran, the more intent the brute became
to get away from them. The father uttered an exclamation
of anguish, and galloped his horse in the direction
the lady’s steed had taken. The students were
almost paralyzed with fear for the safety of the beautiful
girl. The runaway pony turned a corner at the end
of the garden; and, at this moment, Scott darted
across the grounds, leaped over a high wall, and came
into a road in the rear of the estate, the geography of
which he had been studying from the top of the Pico
de Sao Joao. He came into the road just ahead of the
horse; and he was a long distance in advance of the
grooms and the lady’s father. Dona Maria had evidently
lost her footing in the stirrup; for she had
slipped partly off the saddle, and was clinging with
both hands to the pommel.</p>

<p>Scott had thrown off his uniform coat as he ran
across the garden, so that he might be free to act
when he tackled the horse; and he felt strong enough
just then to throw him over the high wall if he could
get hold of him. He sprang into the middle of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
road; and it was nothing more than a narrow lane,
leading to the stables of the estate, which the pony
seemed to prefer to an excursion in the delightful air of
the afternoon. The vicious little brute saw him, and
attempted to pass at one side of him; but Scott was
quick enough to catch him by the bridle-rein. Then
came the tug of war; for the pony was not disposed to
be so easily captured, and began to rear and plunge
to disengage himself from his captor. But Scott was
used to horses, and held on. In a moment he had
brought the horse down sufficiently to enable him to
put his arm around the waist of the maiden, and lift
her to the ground.</p>

<p>She was out of breath, so that she could not speak,
though she gasped out some sentences in her native
tongue, which Scott could not understand. She was
too weak to stand; and the gallant lieutenant was compelled
to hold her with one arm, and the horse with
the other, till assistance came. Don Roderigue was
the first to arrive upon the spot. He leaped from his
horse, and seized his daughter in his arms.</p>

<p>“Was she thrown from the horse?” he asked.</p>

<p>“No, sir: I don’t think she can be much hurt,” replied
Scott; and he described her position at the moment
he had stopped the pony.</p>

<p>By this time Dona Maria was able to speak for herself;
and Scott thought she had a very musical voice,
though, as she spoke in Portuguese, he could not understand
a word she said. The gallop in that uncomfortable
position must have jarred her frame considerably.
The grooms came up, and took charge of the horses.</p>

<p>“Young gentleman, I owe you very great thanks for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
the service you have rendered to my daughter and to
me,” said Don Roderigue, extending his hand to the
lieutenant.</p>

<p>“Don’t mention it, sir,” exclaimed Scott, laughing
at the earnestness of the grateful father. “We were
on the top of that pico, and I saw this road leading
down to the stable. When the horse started, I thought
it likely, as he turned the first corner, that he would
make for the place where he got his oats; and I took
a short cut over here. I happened to be just in the
nick of time for business.”</p>

<p>Scott jabbered this off as fast as he could, while he
blushed like a red rose, apparently to interrupt the
flow of grateful expressions to which the gentleman
was disposed to give utterance. When he had finished
his explanation of the manner in which he had happened
to save the young lady from a greater disaster,
she walked up to him, with a sweet smile on her face,
and extended her hand to him. He could not do less
than take it, though he felt and looked very sheepish
about it. Almost any of the officers of the squadron
who had passed the age of sixteen would have been
delighted to take such a little hand as that; but there
was not one in the whole crowd who was so little of a
lady’s man as Scott. When he took the pretty hand,
Maria spoke to him in Portuguese, and shook his great
paw.</p>

<p>“Those are my sentiments exactly; and I couldn’t
have said it half as well myself,” he replied, with a
broad grin on his face.</p>

<p>“Speak to him in English, Maria: he does not
understand you,” interposed Don Roderigue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>“I shall thank you very much for what you have did
for me,” said she laughing, perhaps because Scott did,
or perhaps at the quality of her own English.</p>

<p>Scott bowed, touched his cap, and turned red again.
He was very anxious to have the subject changed, and
insisted that Madeira was a fine country.</p>

<p>“I say I shall tank you ver much for what you have
did for me,” repeated she, evidently a little vexed.</p>

<p>“Don’t mention it. This is a delightful climate you
have here in Madeira,” stammered Scott.</p>

<p>“He don’t understand my English,” pouted the little
beauty, shaking her shoulders; but, as she spoke in her
own language, Scott could not understand her.</p>

<p>“Maria says she thanks you very much for what you
have done for her; and she is very sorry she cannot
make herself understood in English,” said Don Roderigue.</p>

<p>“I understood her perfectly,” replied Scott.</p>

<p>“But you told her not to mention it; and I am sure
that would be very ungrateful in her.”</p>

<p>“I only meant that what I did was not worth the
trouble of mentioning it.”</p>

<p>“Now say it to him again, Maria, and he will understand
you,” continued her father.</p>

<p>“I shall thank you very much for what you have
did for me,” added Maria, turning to Scott, with a mischievous
twinkle in her bright eyes.</p>

<p>“I understand you as well as though you had been
my next-door neighbor in the United States of America
all your lifetime,” replied Scott, with his broad grin.</p>

<p>“Oh! now you spokes too much, and I can’t understand
what you speaks,” chattered the maiden.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>“I am happy to please you,” said Scott, measuring
off the words one at a time.</p>

<p>“She has begun to learn English, and she speaks
very little yet,” added her father.</p>

<p>“I am much glad,” shouted Maria, dancing with
delight when she realized that her English had been
understood. “I shall forget you never.”</p>

<p>“Beautiful country!” added Scott, flourishing his
right hand around him.</p>

<p>“Ver beaut’ful,” cried Maria. “My horse,” and then
she pointed at the pony, and made her hands fly up and
down in imitation of the feet of the animal.</p>

<p>“Ran away,” replied Scott, completing the sentence
when she broke down.</p>

<p>“My horse ran away!” she shouted, with childish
vim, though she was not less than sixteen. “You stop
my horse. I thank you ver much for what you have
did.”</p>

<p>“May I ride your horse?” asked Scott.</p>

<p>“You? ride horse?”</p>

<p>The young officer then indicated what he wanted in
pantomime. Don Roderigue declared that the pony had
always been very gentle, and had never behaved so
badly before since he was a colt. He added that Scott
might ride him if he wished to do so. The joker leaped
upon his back as lightly as a cat; but the little beast
began to rear and plunge and dive in the most extraordinary
manner. Scott was a good horseman, and the
pony could not throw him.</p>

<p>“I am confident something ails this horse,” said he,
dismounting.</p>

<p>He then unbuckled the girth, and Don Roderigue<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
ordered the groom to assist in the operation. The saddle
was removed, and a large spot of blood was found
on the skin of the horse. Scott looked at it, and found
a wound, made by the sharp point of a nail which had
been driven through the wooden part of the saddle-frame.</p>

<p>“I don’t blame the horse for making a row,” said
Scott, as he pointed out the wound. “Any horse would
make a fuss with that nail sticking into him;” and as
he spoke he took his knife, and dug out the offensive
iron.</p>

<p>Maria laughed and danced about all the time; and
when the cause of the pony’s misconduct was discovered,
and shown to her, she began to pet the animal in the
most loving manner. She was glad to find that her
steed had a good excuse for his bad behavior. The
saddle was restored to his back, and Scott mounted
him again. This time he acted as well as any pony
could.</p>

<p>“You ride?” asked Scott.</p>

<p>“Yes: I ride.”</p>

<p>Her father did not object, and the lieutenant lifted
her into the saddle. She cantered off as briskly as
though nothing had happened. Don Roderigue insisted
that Scott should mount his horse, and ride back to
the garden gate, where he had left the rest of the party.
In a moment he overtook the lady. She chatted and
laughed all the way, and Scott felt more as though
he had fallen into a sugar-bowl than ever before in
his life.</p>

<p>Don Roderigue decided to postpone his ride, and to
entertain the party. Maria seemed not to be sorry for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
the change of programme; and Scott presented her to
all his brother officers and to the surgeon. They spent
a delightful afternoon among the budding flowers and
orange-groves of the magnificent estate of their host. He
was an exceedingly hospitable man, and the supper prepared
for them was an elaborate banquet. He was very
much surprised that all his guests should refuse to partake
of the old and rare wines he set before them; but
the doctor was able to give him a satisfactory explanation
of their refusal, so that he did not feel hurt.</p>

<p>When they were ready to depart, they found two of
the sleds of the country ready at the door, in which
they were to descend the long hill to the city. They
took their seats; and a man placed himself on each
side of the sled, holding a rope from the forward end
of the runner to guide and control the vehicle. They
made the descent very rapidly; and the students declared
it was almost as good as coasting on the snow.</p>

<p>The next day Don Roderigue, his wife and daughter,
visited the vessels of the squadron, and were treated
with the distinguished consideration to which their
social standing entitled them. The Portuguese gentleman
was delighted with the order and the nautical
evolutions of the young sailors. In return for the
courtesy extended to him and his family, Don Roderigue
invited all hands to spend a day at the “Quinta da
Son Joao;” and he insisted that all should come.
They all went; and the officers and seamen had the
gayest lark of the year.</p>

<p>Quite a number of Portuguese, English, and French
young ladies were also invited; and the dancing in the
great hall of the mansion was kept up till midnight.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
Two days later the liberal host invited the party he had
first met to visit the <i>Curral</i>, and ascend the Pico Ruivo.
He provided horses, guides, and servants for the excursion,
and entertained them royally till their return to
the vessels.</p>

<p>The <i>Curral</i> is the greatest natural curiosity in Madeira.
It is a vast ravine, and may once have formed a
deep lake. It is surrounded by lofty mountains, which
add greatly to the grandeur of the scenery. It reminded
the students of the “Dry Dock,” as they called
it, in the Saxon Switzerland.</p>

<p>The <i>Curral</i> is about thirteen hundred feet deep, and
the greater portion of its sides are perpendicular rock.
Every thing in the vicinity is very picturesque, and the
students were delighted with the excursion.</p>

<small>CONCERNING THE MISSING STEAMER.</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">“THERE is a steamer coming into port!” shouted
one of the idlers in the fore-top of the American
Prince, one morning after the squadron had been a
week at Funchal.</p>

<p>A dozen glasses were brought to bear upon the
approaching steamer, which was coming in from the
north-east. She was not a large vessel, and was
square-rigged forward, like the Ville d’Angers; but it
could not yet be determined whether she had two or
three masts, as she was headed directly towards the
Loo Rock. The picked-up steamer was barkentine
rigged; and, so far as could be judged at that distance,
the new-comer was about her size.</p>

<p>The American Prince had been out on a three-days’
cruise in search of the Ville d’Angers. She had spoken
several vessels without obtaining any intelligence of
the missing steamer. She had just returned to Funchal.
Mr. Lowington was very much depressed at the
ill success of the expedition; but Mr. Fluxion insisted
that the Ville d’Angers was all right. She had plenty
of coal, plenty of provisions, and she was a good,
strongly-built vessel: he had examined her in detail,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
and he did not believe that the students could have
foundered her if they had tried to do so. The worst he
could conceive that had happened to her was, that she
had broken some of her machinery, and had drifted
away to leeward before the south-east winds which had
been prevailing for a week.</p>

<p>“But you say her sails were in good order and condition,”
replied the principal. “I presume her commander
knew enough to get sail upon her if her engine
was disabled.”</p>

<p>“If he did, he has had a head-wind all the time, and
will have to beat his vessel all the way. It is very
likely the steamer is not in good sailing-trim, for such
craft as she is don’t work well under sail alone,” continued
Mr. Fluxion.</p>

<p>“But that vessel coming into this port is using
steam,” said Mr. Lowington, as he directed his glass
towards her again.</p>

<p>“Of course I can’t tell what has happened to the
Ville d’Angers, but I feel quite confident that she is all
right. We have had no very bad weather since we
parted company, and not a great deal of fog near the
islands,” persisted Mr. Fluxion, who felt it “in his
bones” that the steamer and her crew were safe, though
he could give no good reason for his belief.</p>

<p>“I think that is not the steamer you have described,”
said Mr. Lowington, in heavy tones; for he
was very sad at heart.</p>

<p>“I don’t think it is, myself,” added the vice-principal.
“This one has only two masts, if I mistake not. She
is a very fast sailer though.”</p>

<p>For half an hour longer all hands watched the approaching<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
steamer, which left a long line of dense
black smoke for miles astern of her. It was settled
that it was not the Ville d’Angers, for she was rigged
as a topsail schooner. She was a very jaunty-looking
craft, with raking masts, and smoke-stack; and she cut
her way through the water like a fish, creating hardly
any commotion in the waves around her. Outside she
was painted a shining black, while inboard she was
milk-white. Her rigging was hauled taut, and every
thing about her was as neat and ship-shape as on board
a man-of-war.</p>

<p>“That is not the Ville d’Angers; but, as she comes
down from the north-east, she may have seen her,” said
Mr. Lowington, putting away his glass, which was no
longer needed to observe the approaching craft.</p>

<p>“She is so trim and taut, I think she must be a
man-of-war,” added Mr. Fluxion. “She looks like one
of our smaller gunboats. I see she has the American
flag at her peak.”</p>

<p>“She carries a private signal at her foremast head,”
continued the principal, taking his glass from the
brackets on the companion-way. “Can you make it
out, Mr. Fluxion?”</p>

<p>“It blows out straight from us, so that I cannot see
the letters upon it.”</p>

<p>“Young gentlemen, can you make out the letters on
the private signal of that steamer?” asked the principal,
turning to the students, who were as much interested
in the new-comer as the faculty were.</p>

<p>“I have it, sir,” replied one of the sharp-eyed students,
who had been studying this signal for some time.
“It is an arrow, with the word ‘Marian’ above, and an
‘R’ below it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>“Then it is not the Ville d’Angers, nor a man-of-war,”
said Mr. Lowington very sadly. “I hoped it
might be the latter, at least; for she would have been
more likely to be able to give us some information in
regard to the missing vessel.”</p>

<p>“On board the Prince!” shouted Mr. Pelham from
the deck of the Tritonia, which was moored next to the
steamer.</p>

<p>“On board of the Tritonia!” returned Carson, the
first lieutenant of the ship.</p>

<p>“That steamer is the Marian, Judge Rodwood’s
yacht,” replied Mr. Pelham.</p>

<p>Carson communicated this information to the principal,
for neither he nor Mr. Fluxion knew the name of
the judge’s steam-yacht; or they did not recognize it
if they had heard it mentioned. By this time the Marian
had stopped her screw off the Loo Rock; and the
government boat was pulling out to her. As she had
a clean bill of health from her last port, she was subjected
to no detention; and the government officers
assigned her a place to moor near the Josephine. As
she passed under the stern of the Prince, two gentlemen
were seen on her rail, who seemed to regard the
Prince with great interest. One of them was a tall
man, with a white beard and white hair; he pointed to
the name on the stern, and became quite excited.</p>

<p>“That must be Judge Rodwood,” said Mr. Fluxion.
“He has come to look for his runaway ward.”</p>

<p>“And I wish we had his runaway ward for him,”
added the principal. “However, I do not feel that
any one is to blame for what has transpired.”</p>

<p>“Certainly not,” replied Mr. Fluxion. “We could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
not bring in the steamer without the young gentlemen;
and that was just the kind of experience they needed
to fit them for the business of life.”</p>

<p>“I have sent the young men away in charge of one
of the vessels of the squadron several times, and this
is the first time any of them has failed to report where
he was ordered,” continued the principal. “Wainwright
brought the Tritonia from the Baltic up the
Mediterranean alone, when the vice-principal on board
was worse than useless, and anchored her safely in the
Golden Horn.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; and you may depend upon it that O’Hara
will do as well on the present occasion as Wainwright
did,” replied the vice-principal cheerfully.</p>

<p>“I hope he will; but I would give a thousand dollars
at this moment to know that he and his shipmates are
safe and well.”</p>

<p>“Possibly this steam-yacht will be able to afford us
some information,” suggested Mr. Fluxion.</p>

<p>“There is a remote chance that she may have seen
her. The judge telegraphed to his ward at Gibraltar
from London: as he got no answer to his letter or
despatch, possibly he went to Gibraltar on his way to
Funchal. If O’Hara could not make his way against
the head-wind, after he broke his machinery, he may
have headed his vessel for the nearest port, which is
Lisbon or Cadiz. The Marian may have seen the
Ville d’Angers,” reasoned Mr. Lowington.</p>

<p>“But that steamer has not had time to go to Gibraltar,
and then come down to Madeira, since we sailed
from that port. I don’t believe she has been to Gib.”</p>

<p>“We shall soon know; for here comes a boat from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
the steam-yacht,” added Mr. Lowington, as a dashing
barge, with crimson velvet cushions in her stern-sheets,
pulled up to the accommodation steps.</p>

<p>The six seamen who were at the oars were dressed
in uniform, and had the word “Marian” in gold letters
on their hats. Every thing about the boat was very
stylish, as it was about the yacht itself. The tall
gentleman with the white hair and beard, who wore
the uniform of the New York Yacht Club, led the way
up the stairs, and was the first to come upon the deck
of the Prince. He was followed by the captain of the
yacht and a gentleman in civilian’s dress. Mr. Lowington
was at the gangway to receive the visitors. The
judge touched his cap, and so did the principal.</p>

<p>“Are you the captain of this steamer?” asked the
judge.</p>

<p>“No, sir; but I am principal of the academy squadron,
of which this is the chief vessel; and I am really,
though not nominally, the commander of the ship,”
replied Mr. Lowington, who usually allowed the captain
to answer such questions, in order to give him the
needed experience in all affairs relating to the vessel.</p>

<p>“Then you are the gentleman I wish to see,” continued
Judge Rodwood, introducing himself, and then
presenting Capt. Goodwin, the commander of the
Marian.</p>

<p>“Capt. Goodwin!” exclaimed the principal, as he
glanced at the person named. “I ought to know him,
for he was formerly one of my pupils,” and he grasped
the hand of the captain.</p>

<p>“I am very glad indeed to meet you again, Mr.
Lowington,” replied Capt. Goodwin. “You see that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
I am making use of the practical knowledge I obtained
in the Young America; and I was very sorry to hear
that the old ship had gone to the bottom.”</p>

<p>“Capt. Goodwin has told me all about your academy;
and he always speaks of you with the highest
respect and regard,” interposed Judge Rodwood.
“But have you a young man among your students by
the name of Thomas Speers?”</p>

<p>“We have such a name on our books; but I regret
to say that he is away just now, and we are not a little
anxious about him and his companions,” answered
Mr. Lowington very seriously.</p>

<p>The principal then detailed all the circumstances
connected with the absence of Tom Speers. Mr. Pelham
was sent for; and he was very glad to meet
Goodwin, who had been a pupil with him when the
Young America first crossed the Atlantic. He explained
more particularly why the despatch and the
letter had not been opened sooner.</p>

<p>“Then the young rascal has purposely kept away
from me,” said Judge Rodwood. “His uncle has left
him three millions of dollars; and he makes me chase
him all over the world to put him in possession of his
fortune. As Tom is nearly twenty-one, I thought I
should be doing him a good turn if I took him out of
school. The Marian really belonged to Tom’s uncle;
and, as the boy is fond of the sea, I thought I would
give him the benefit of it. I used to keep the best
state-room on board for Mr. Speers; and I still reserve
it for his heir.”</p>

<p>“I should have discharged the young man if I had
received your letter in season to do so before we sailed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
from Gibraltar, and sent him on to London,” added
Mr. Lowington.</p>

<p>“But it seems that he does not wish to be sent off;
and in that case I am willing that he should remain in
your academy,” observed Judge Rodwood. “If he
had telegraphed to me that he did not wish to leave his
vessel, I should have been perfectly satisfied, and permitted
him to remain. In fact, I am not legally his
guardian yet, for the young man has a voice in the
business himself.”</p>

<p>“Do you hail from Gibraltar now, sir?” asked the
principal.</p>

<p>“No, sir: I have not been anywhere near Gibraltar.
When I received no reply to my despatch or letter, I
telegraphed to a correspondent of our banking-house,
and learned that your squadron had sailed for Funchal,
and that young Speers had undoubtedly gone
in the vessel to which he belonged. I am off on a
cruise; and I was rather pleased with the idea of going
to Madeira in search of my ward.”</p>

<p>“Then you are direct from England?”</p>

<p>“I am: the Marian is six days from Southampton.
As I was anxious to find young Speers before you left
these islands, I required the captain to hurry her; and
I think we made fifteen knots an hour a good part of
the voyage.”</p>

<p>“I am very anxious indeed about the safety of
Speers and his shipmates,” continued Mr. Lowington;
“and I hoped, when I saw your steamer, that you
would be able to give us some information in regard to
the steamer picked up by the Tritonia.”</p>

<p>“We haven’t seen her; have we, Capt. Goodwin?”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
asked the judge, turning to the commander of the
Marian.</p>

<p>“Think not: indeed, we have seen but one steamer
during the trip, at least after we got off into blue
water,” replied Capt. Goodwin.</p>

<p>“We saw a steamer towing a dismasted vessel, you
remember,” interposed Dr. Phelps, the other gentleman
of the party from the Marian, who was making the
voyage for his health with his friend the judge.</p>

<p>“True: I did not think of her. The other was a P.
and O. steamer, bound into Southampton,” added
Goodwin. “What sort of a vessel was it the Tritonia
picked up?”</p>

<p>“She is a screw steamer of about six hundred tons,
three masts, square-rigged forward,” replied Mr. Pelham.
“She is painted black; and her cabin is under
a poop-deck. She is long, and very narrow for her
length. Her name is the Ville d’Angers, and she has
a French register. She was abandoned by her ship’s
company, for she had a hole stove in her starboard
bow by a collision with another vessel; but her damages
had been thoroughly repaired.”</p>

<p>“The steamer that was towing the dismasted vessel
corresponds to the description you give of the Ville
d’Angers,” said Capt. Goodwin. “But I suppose half
the steamers that ply between the ports of England
and the Continent would fill the bill as well.”</p>

<p>“I was looking through the glass at that steamer for
half an hour,” interposed Dr. Phelps. “I was sitting
on deck with nothing else to do; and I was trying to
ascertain the condition of things on board of the dismasted
vessel.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>“Did you notice any thing particular about her?”
asked Capt. Goodwin. “But we didn’t go within two
miles of her; though I noted in my log the fact that we
passed a steamer towing a dismasted vessel.”</p>

<p>“The glass was a very powerful one; and I tried to
make out the people on board of the wreck and of the
steamer, but I could not.”</p>

<p>“Did the steamer sit low in the water, or was she
well up?” asked Mr. Pelham.</p>

<p>“I am not a nautical man, and I am not a competent
judge; but I should say she was more out of the water
than the Marian,” replied the doctor.</p>

<p>“Could you tell what color she was painted?”</p>

<p>“Black, while the vessel she was towing was green;
and I noticed this fact particularly, for it was an odd
color for a vessel, as I understood the matter. I was
going to say, in regard to the steamer, that she was not
black the whole length of her, on the side next to me.”</p>

<p>“On which hand did you leave the steamer and her
tow, Goodwin?” asked Mr. Pelham, beginning to be a
little excited over the matter.</p>

<p>“This was off Ushant; and we were on the shore
hand of her.”</p>

<p>“You left her on the starboard hand; and the steamer
was headed which way?”</p>

<p>“She was going a little east of north; and I concluded
that she intended to make either Plymouth or
Southampton. She may have gone more to the eastward
when she was well up with the cape,” added Capt.
Goodwin.</p>

<p>“Then it was the starboard side of the steamer that
was seen by Dr. Phelps?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>“Certainly it was: she was on our starboard, headed
to the northward,” replied Goodwin.</p>

<p>“You said the steamer was not black the whole
length of her, Dr. Phelps?” continued the vice-principal
of the Tritonia, warming up still more as the investigation
proceeded.</p>

<p>“I said so; but, if you give me any nautical conundrums,
I can’t guess them,” answered the passenger,
laughing.</p>

<p>“What color was the part of the steamer that was
not black, if you please, Dr. Phelps?” asked Mr. Pelham.</p>

<p>“It was a kind of straw-color; possibly yellow. It
was a sort of an irregular patch at the forward part of
the vessel. If it had been on the roof of an old barn
in the country, I should say that it had a lot of new
shingles laid among the old ones,” answered the doctor.</p>

<p>“Precisely so! and that part of the steamer’s side
near the forward part of her—and that was on her
starboard bow—was the new planking of the Ville
d’Angers,” exclaimed Mr. Pelham excitedly. “I would
not give any one ten cents to insure my statement that
the steamer towing the dismasted vessel was the Ville
d’Angers!”</p>

<p>“It may be,” replied the principal, musing.</p>

<p>“I am confident I am right.”</p>

<p>“I think you are, Pelham,” added Mr. Fluxion, who
was particularly pleased to have his hopeful theory
substantiated.</p>

<p>“But the Ville d’Angers must have made good time,
towing a wreck, to have been off Ushant when you saw
her there,” suggested the principal. “It is hardly possible
it was she.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>“It took us three days to make Funchal after we lost
sight of the Ville d’Angers,” said Mr. Fluxion, figuring
with a pencil on the back of a letter. “When did you
see this steamer, Capt. Goodwin?”</p>

<p>“In the first part of our second day out,” replied the
captain of the Marian.</p>

<p>“Then the Ville d’Angers had five days to make
Ushant; and she could easily do it in that time: she
had the wind with her all the way.”</p>

<p>“And she had all her sails set; and it was blowing
fresh when we saw her. They had a jury-mast on the
wreck, with some sail on it,” added Capt. Goodwin.</p>

<p>“It blew a gale in the Bay of Biscay the next day,
and I have no doubt it extended up to the coast of
England,” said Judge Rodwood. “Do I understand
you, Mr. Lowington, that you send these boys off on
such expeditions as this one?”</p>

<p>“Some of these boys, as you call them, judge, are
older than I was when I had the command of a full-rigged
ship for a time. No, I do not send them off on
such expeditions when I can avoid it. I have told you
that our friend Mr. Frisbone was on board of the
steamer; and my young gentlemen had the alternative
of leaving him and his ladies on board, or taking possession
of her. I think they acted wisely, though I
cannot explain the conduct of the present commander
of the Ville d’Angers in towing this wreck to England.”</p>

<p>“In my judgment he had a good reason for doing
so,” added Mr. Fluxion. “O’Hara is twenty years
old; Gregory, his first officer, is nineteen; Speers is
the second officer, and he is nearly twenty-one. The
other two officers are about the same age. There isn’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
a fellow among them that is not fit to take that steamer
to any port in the world; and no officers, even in the
navy, have been so thoroughly trained in the discharge
of their duties.”</p>

<p>Mr. Fluxion got just a little excited in the defence of
the policy of the principal. He had been an instructor
in the institution since it was organized, and he knew
the nature of the training the students had received;
and any one who was fit to be an officer had been
obliged to work his way up to the position.</p>

<p>“You think the steamer was bound to Southampton,
do you, Capt. Goodwin?” asked Mr. Pelham.</p>

<p>“I have not the least idea for what port she was
bound; but she was going east of north when I saw
her last, so that she could not have been bound for
Liverpool, or any port up the west coast,” replied Capt.
Goodwin. “I should judge that she would be most
likely to go into Southampton; for she would find the
least difficulty in the navigation in making that her
destination.”</p>

<p>“Then she probably got into Southampton four days
ago,” added Mr. Pelham. “Very likely she put about
immediately, and sailed for Funchal. She may be here
by to-morrow or next day.”</p>

<p>“Unless the agents or the owners happen to see
her, and put in a claim upon her,” suggested Mr.
Fluxion: “her case has to be settled in the courts
yet.”</p>

<p>“Southampton will be a good place for the business,”
said the principal; “but that will leave her ship’s company
in England without a vessel.”</p>

<p>“Leave that to O’Hara; and Tom Speers has money<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
enough to pay the passage of all his shipmates to Madeira
in the next steamer,” said the judge, laughing.
“But Frisbone is with them; and I am sure he will see
them through all right. It is hardly worth while to
worry about them. I desire to see young Speers very
much indeed; and, if he prefers to retain his place in
the Tritonia as first master, I shall make no objection.
If I thought I should find him at Southampton, I would
return there at once. Can you advise me what to do,
Mr. Lowington?”</p>

<p>“The chances are, as Mr. Pelham suggests, that the
Ville d’Angers will return to Funchal at once; and
you had better remain here a few days at least. If the
steamer does not appear in three days, I am inclined
to think I shall run over to Lisbon, or some other port,
where I shall be likely to obtain some intelligence of
the missing vessel. If we could get at the ship-news
for the last week, we should know whether this steamer
had gone into Southampton or not.”</p>

<p>“Then I will remain here a short time,” said the
judge. “The African mail-steamer is due here in a
few days; and she will bring the latest ship-news.”</p>

<p>“We have almost taken it for granted that the
steamer towing the dismasted vessel was the Ville
d’Angers; but we may be mistaken, after all. Any
other vessel may have had her side planked up; and it
is not a very unusual thing for a steamer to have her
bow stove in,” added the principal. But he was hopeful
that the vessel described would prove to be the
missing steamer; and it removed in a measure a heavy
load from his mind.</p>

<p>After breakfast the principal and some of the young<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
officers visited the Marian by invitation. In the afternoon
Scott and his party visited the quinta of Don
Roderigue; and the second lieutenant of the Tritonia
felt sufficiently at home there to invite the judge and
the doctor to accompany them, for he had been assured
that any of his friends would be welcome there.</p>

<p>Three days passed away in the enjoyment of the
scenery and the hospitalities of Madeira; but the
Ville d’Angers did not arrive.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII.<br>

<small>A MUTINY IN THE FIRE-ROOM.</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">AS no one could see the Ville d’Angers and the
two schooners in the dense fog that settled
down upon them after the crew of the steamer had
been re-organized, it would be difficult to determine
precisely in what manner they were separated. Capt.
O’Hara did not start the screw of the steamer until he
had stationed his ship’s company in accordance with
his instructions given by the senior vice-principal. If
there was any fault anywhere, it was in the instructions.</p>

<p>Observations had been taken on board of all the
vessels at noon, and the course for the Madeira Islands
was ascertained to be south-west, half-west; and the two
schooners went off in this direction, with the wind from
the southward, but veering to the west. O’Hara used
up about two hours in stationing his crew, arranging
the quarters of the officers and seamen, and in giving
his instructions. By this time the Tritonia and the
Josephine were a dozen miles on their way, and they
looked like white specks on the ocean to the naked
eye. The young captain believed that the Ville d’Angers,
from what she had done, would sail twelve knots
an hour; and at this rate he could overhaul the rest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
of the fleet in a couple of hours. But the Ville d’Angers
was hardly under way before the fog settled down
upon her, and shut out the schooners from view.</p>

<p>The heavy whistle of the steamer could be heard for
a long distance; but the bell and fog-horn of the other
vessels could not be distinguished by the lookout of
the Ville d’Angers. Then the wind hauled to the
westward, heading off the sailing-vessels. O’Hara was
watching the weather and the vessels very closely all
the time; and, though the direction of the wind did not
greatly affect the steamer, he saw that the Josephine
and Tritonia could no longer lay their course.</p>

<p>He continued the steamer on the course given out
for two hours, without seeing or hearing any thing of
his consorts. The captain began to be a little worried;
for he would as soon have thought of drowning himself
as of disobeying the orders of the senior vice-principal,
and going off on an independent cruise. It was
evident enough to him, that the schooners had tacked,
or had been crowded off their course by the changing
wind; he could not tell whether they had gone to the
westward or southward. He wished Mr. Fluxion had
told him what he should do under such circumstances
as the present, which might have been easily foreseen.</p>

<p>“Upon my sowl, I am afraid we shall part company
with the rest of the fleet,” said the captain to Tom
Speers, who was on the deck.</p>

<p>“It seems to me we have done it already,” replied
the second officer.</p>

<p>“That’s a fact! Now the wind has changed, and it
bothers me to know whether the schooners have tacked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
and stood to the southward, or kept as close to the
wind as they could, and gone off to the westward.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t possible to tell what they have done.”</p>

<p>“That’s true for you!” added the captain, musing.
“Now let us think it over seriously. We ought to have
overhauled the Josephine and Tritonia just where we
are at this moment,” and he glanced at the clock that
hung in the pilot-house. “But there is no sight nor
sound of them here.—Blow the whistle, Mr. Raymond,
if you please.”</p>

<p>“We have whistled every five minutes since the fog
settled down upon us,” replied the fourth officer, as he
sounded it again.</p>

<p>It was time to heave the log, and the officer of the
quarter-watch left the pilot-house to attend to this duty.
In a few moments he reported the steamer as going
only eight knots an hour. O’Hara was vexed at this
low rate of speed; for he was persuaded that the
steamer was good for at least twelve knots. He went
to the engine-room to inquire into the matter. Richards
was in charge of the engine; and he was seated on
his cushioned bench, reading a novel.</p>

<p>“What the blazes are you doing in here?” shouted
the captain, abating no little of his natural politeness.
“Sure, the steamer is making only eight knots an hour
by the last log; and the schooners will bate us out at
this rate.”</p>

<p>“We are making but thirty-eight revolutions a minute;
and eight miles is all that can be expected,” replied
the assistant engineer.</p>

<p>“Well, what’s the matter with her?” demanded
O’Hara, not a little excited.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>“I can’t get steam enough to do any better,” replied
Richards rather doggedly, for he did not like the manner
in which the captain had spoken to him.</p>

<p>“Can’t you get all the steam you want?” asked
O’Hara, in a more moderate tone; for he began to see
that his manner was a little too arbitrary.</p>

<p>“I have called down into the fire-room twenty times
for more steam, and I have been down myself; but I
don’t seem to make myself understood,” replied Richards
in a more affable tone, corresponding to that of
the captain.</p>

<p>“Those blackguards of firemen are not doing their
duty!” exclaimed O’Hara, rushing down to the fire-room,
believing the difficulty was altogether in the
matter of language.</p>

<p>He spoke to the Italian in his own language; and
the fellow shrugged his shoulders, and looked insolent,
though he said nothing to which exception could be taken.</p>

<p>“Fill up your furnaces!” shouted the captain, repeating
the words in French for the benefit of the ones
who did not understand Italian. “We are making but
eight knots an hour; and we shall lose the rest of the
fleet at this rate!”</p>

<p>The men heaved in a few shovels of coal; and
O’Hara, believing he had said and done all that was
necessary, left the fire-room. He went upon the poop-deck,
where he found Tom Speers; and both of them
gazed out into the dense fog, and listened for any
sounds that might indicate the situation of the rest of
the fleet.</p>

<p>“Do you make out any thing, Speers, darlint?”
asked the captain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>“Nothing at all,” replied Tom. “In my opinion we
have seen the last we shall of the schooners till we get
to Funchal.”</p>

<p>“Don’t say that, Tom: I would rather lose my
command than part company with the rest of the
fleet.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see why you need mourn about the matter.
We know where we are bound, and we can get there
without any help from the schooners,” added Tom.</p>

<p>“If we lose them they will say we did it on purpose.”</p>

<p>“They can’t say that; for our log will show just how
it happened, after we compare it with those of the other
vessels.”</p>

<p>The young captain was very impatient; and, after
waiting half an hour, he ordered the officer of the
watch to heave the log again. It was done, and the
report was only seven knots.</p>

<p>“Faix, it seemed to me she was going at a snail’s
pace,” said O’Hara, now thoroughly roused by the
tardy movement of the vessel.</p>

<p>“I don’t understand it,” added Tom.</p>

<p>At this moment one of the crew who had been detailed
to act as an oiler, because he had a taste for
working on machinery, came upon the upper deck.</p>

<p>“Mr. Richards directs me to report to the captain
that the engine is making but thirty revolutions a minute,
and that the firemen won’t do any better,” said
the oiler.</p>

<p>“That’s what the matter! Bad luck to those same
blackguards of firemen! We should have done better
with some of the fellows in the fire-room!” exclaimed
O’Hara, as he hastened down to the main deck.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>He had hardly reached the foot of the ladder before
Mr. Frisbone hailed him, coming out of the cabin.</p>

<p>“What’s the trouble, Capt. O’Hara?” shouted the
Prince, in his usual loud tone, though the captain was
not six feet from him. “I’ve been taking a nap; and,
when I waked up, I thought the steamer had stopped;
but I found she was moving a little. Is any thing out
of kilter?”</p>

<p>“We are making but six knots an hour, sir; and the
rascals of firemen won’t work,” replied O’Hara.</p>

<p>“Won’t work? What’s got into them?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, sir: I am going down into the fire-room
to see what the trouble is.”</p>

<p>“All right: that’s the way to do business; and I’ll
go down with you,” added the Prince.</p>

<p>They stopped in the engine-room to hear what the
engineer had to say about it. Richards had been
down, and had called in French a dozen times for
more steam; but the firemen would not do any better.
He had found the furnace-doors open; and he concluded
that the Italians and Frenchmen had concluded
to strike for higher wages, though they had received
their own price for their services.</p>

<p>“We will soon see about that!” exclaimed O’Hara,
as he began to descend the iron steps into the fire-room.</p>

<p>“I guess we can straighten them out,” added the
Prince, as he followed the captain.</p>

<p>They found the firemen—not only the watch on duty,
but all of them—seated in the airiest part of the room,
smoking their pipes and cigars as coolly as though
every thing was going well on board. The doors of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
the furnaces were fastened wide open, and the steam
was rapidly diminishing in pressure.</p>

<p>“What are you about?” demanded O’Hara, very
indignant at the state of things he found in the fire-room.</p>

<p>Mr. Frisbone went to the furnaces at the same time,
for it was of no avail for him to say any thing to these
men who did not understand his language. He closed
the doors of the furnaces, which were tolerably well
supplied with coal, and opened the draughts. As he did
so, one of the Frenchmen came up to him, followed by
two more.</p>

<p>“<i>Non! Non!</i>” shouted one of them, as he closed
the draught, and threw open the doors again.</p>

<p>He proceeded to make a rather violent speech in his
own language, which was not understood by the Prince.
But the latter could understand the man’s actions if
not his words; and they meant rebellion as plainly as
though it had been formally declared in the English
tongue. He was not a man to be set aside by anybody;
and he pushed the Frenchman away, and opened
the doors and draughts again. He had scarcely completed
the task before one of the men struck him a violent
blow on the head, which felled him to the floor.
But he was not badly hurt, and leaped to his feet on
the instant. In the twinkling of an eye he had
knocked over two of his assailants; and the third was
on the point of hitting him on the back of the head
with an iron bar, when O’Hara, seeing his danger,
rushed upon the Frenchman, and, seizing the man by
the neck, jammed his knees into the small of his back
so as to throw him over backwards.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>Richards stood in the engine-room at the head of
the steps, watching the progress of events. When the
Frenchman knocked the Prince over, the engineer
called Shakings and Rimmer, both of whom tumbled
down the steps in season to defend the captain from a
violent assault on the part of the Italians, who were
disposed to make common cause with their fellow-laborers.
Raymond, hearing the noise in the fire-room,
hastened below, followed by Tom Speers.
These ample re-enforcements caused the firemen to
fall back, and place themselves on the defensive.</p>

<p>“I am ready to fight if need be, though I am a man
of peace,” said the Prince, puffing with his exertions.
“But I should like to know what I am fighting for.
What’s the matter? What has caused this row?”</p>

<p>“The men won’t work,” replied O’Hara.</p>

<p>“What’s the reason they won’t work?” demanded
Mr. Frisbone, who was sufficiently familiar with labor
difficulties to be competent to meet any emergency of
this kind. “Aren’t they satisfied with their wages?”</p>

<p>“They want a portion of wine served out to each
man while they are at work,” replied O’Hara, to whom
Alfonzo had explained the desire of the men, and the
reason why they had stopped work.</p>

<p>“Wine!” exclaimed the Prince, in utter disgust.</p>

<p>Mr. Frisbone, as shown in a preceding volume of
this series, was a very fierce temperance man, and did
not believe that intoxicating drinks of any kind, not
even wine and beer of the mildest type, were proper
for use under any circumstances. He did not tolerate
the drinking customs of any nation he visited. He
never tasted the cup in any form himself, never gave<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
it to his neighbor, or permitted it to be given to him
if he had the power to prevent it.</p>

<p>“Alfonzo says they asked for wine on board of the
Josephine, and were told there was none on board.
He did not believe a statement so absurd as this one
seemed to him; and he and his associates considered
the reply as a refusal to grant their reasonable request.
He thought it was no use to ask for wine again; and
they have struck for it as the only way they are likely
to get it,” explained the captain.</p>

<p>“Struck for wine, have they?” demanded the Prince,
gazing with contempt at the firemen. “But, while we
are settling this question, the fires are going out; and
soon we shall have no steam at all.”</p>

<p>The Prince closed one of the furnace-doors, and
Shakings another. All the draughts were adjusted so
that the fires began to roar.</p>

<p>Alfonzo spoke a few sharp words to his companions;
and they began to arm themselves with such weapons
as were at hand,—pokers, shovels, hammers, iron bars.
Shakings wanted the party to “clean them out” without
any delay. While things were in this attitude, the
cook and one of the stewards came down into the fire-room,
and intimated that they were ready to do duty as
the occasion might require.</p>

<p>“No clubs,” added Shakings, when he saw the steward
pick up a coal-breaker. “We don’t want any
weapons. We can bring them to their senses quicker
without breaking any of their bones; and we want to
use them, not kill them.”</p>

<p>The Prince liked this argument, and warmly seconded
it. The boatswain of the Josephine was the self-constituted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
leader of the party, possibly because there was
more fight in him than in any other. He made a
spring at Alfonzo, who was armed with a hammer used
in breaking coal. He clinched with the fellow, to
whom the weapon in his hand was rather an incumbrance
than otherwise. As he raised it to strike his
assailant, Shakings seized him by the arm. A sharp
struggle ensued; but the stalwart tar was too much for
his opponent, and in a moment he had thrown him to
the floor, and put his foot upon him.</p>

<p>The Prince pitched into the Frenchman who had
struck him before. He wrenched a shovel out of his
hands, and then threw him down. Observing how the
boatswain handled his man, he followed his example,
holding the rascal down with his foot, while he menaced
him with the shovel if he attempted to use his
hands. Rimmer was slower and clumsier than the
boatswain, but he succeeded in taking down one of the
smallest of the Italians. Raymond did not scruple to
tackle another; and so quick were his movements, that
his man was down almost as soon as the leader of the
firemen. All the others went for the remaining two of
the foreigners; and they were soon <i>hors de combat</i>.
The prestige seemed to be with the Americans from
the beginning.</p>

<p>It was a very striking spectacle, even after all the
hitting had been done, to see six men held down on the
floor. Tom Speers had fought like a tiger with a Frenchman
he had tackled alone in the beginning of the affray;
and, though O’Hara came to his aid, it was not till he
had nearly overcome his foe.</p>

<p>“What shall we do with them?” asked the Prince, as
soon as he could obtain breath enough to speak.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>“Who hasn’t his hands full?” demanded the boatswain.</p>

<p>“I haven’t,” replied the captain.</p>

<p>“Then have rope enough sent down to tie these
fellows hand and foot, if you please, captain,” added
Shakings.</p>

<p>But all the watch except the quartermaster and the
seaman at the wheel had heard the noise of the conflict,
and had secured positions where they could see
what was going on in the hold. As soon as they heard
the call of Shakings, they gathered up all the spare line
they could find about the deck and in the lockers, and
threw it down into the fire-room. O’Hara passed them
to the victors in the conflict, and each secured his own
man. The battle was ended, and the victory won.</p>

<p>“Do you want wine now, you villains?” said the
Prince when the conquest was completed.</p>

<p>“But we are pretty much out of firemen,” added the
captain, as he looked at the mutineers, made fast to
the stanchions and other parts of the vessel.</p>

<p>“I am willing to take my turn at the shovels,” replied
the Prince.</p>

<p>By this time the fires in the furnaces were burning in
the most satisfactory manner; and the Prince declared
that the steamer was increasing her speed. The captain
directed that several of the students who had done
duty in the fire-room before the foreigners came on
board should be detailed to serve again. Four of them
appeared in answer to the summons; and, as the novelty
of the occupation had not worn off, they were glad
to be employed in this capacity again. All hands
except the firemen, the boatswain, and the carpenter,
left the fire-room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>The Italians and Frenchmen were fully convinced
that they had made a mistake in refusing to work:
they began to talk among themselves; and some of the
amateurs understood enough of what was said by the
actual firemen, to comprehend that they were ready to
resume their work. But the students said nothing
about what they had heard. In the course of an hour
the foreigners were tired of their confined position, and
begged to be released from durance, promising to do
their duty faithfully.</p>

<p>When the captain came down to see them a little
later, they plead with him; and he consulted with Mr.
Frisbone and the boatswain.</p>

<p>“Let ’em loose, and set ’em to work; but don’t give
’em any wine, or liquor of any sort,” said the Prince.</p>

<p>“I don’t know whether there is any wine on board,”
replied O’Hara. “If there were I wouldn’t give it to
those fellows after they have behaved so badly. But I
don’t think they will give us any more trouble after the
pounding they have had.”</p>

<p>Shakings was directed to release the firemen; and,
when he did so, he blustered and handled them so
roughly, that they seemed to be inspired with a wholesome
terror of his fists. He cuffed and kicked them
more liberally than Capt. O’Hara thought was necessary;
and the latter suggested the propriety of treating
a fallen and submissive foe with a little more magnanimity.</p>

<p>“Bless your heart, captain, it isn’t of any use to treat
such fellows gently. They aren’t used to it. If you
treat them well they will turn upon you, and bite,” replied
Shakings, as he released the last man; but, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
deference to the captain, he failed to kick him as he
had the rest of them.</p>

<p>The three who were on watch sprang to the shovels,
and were disposed to waste the coal in their zeal to do
their duty. The Italians, who were off duty, went to
their quarters under the forecastle. O’Hara did not
like the way they behaved, and he directed Shakings
to keep a close watch over them.</p>

<p>“Have you heard any thing of the rest of the fleet,
Speers?” asked the captain, as he joined the second
officer on the poop-deck.</p>

<p>“I have not; and the fog is thicker than ever,” replied
Speers. “Have you looked at the barometer
lately? It feels like bad weather to me. The sea
seems to have an ugly look, what we can see of it.”</p>

<p>“I looked at it just as I came up; and it indicates
a little more wind than we have been having the last
twelve hours; but I don’t think it is any thing very
bad that’s coming.”</p>

<p>“What was that?” said Tom Speers, suddenly looking
to the northward.</p>

<p>“Well, what was it? I didn’t hear any thing,” replied
O’Hara, gazing in the direction indicated.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what it was; but it sounded like a
gun, or the stroke of a bell,” added Speers.</p>

<p>“Gun on the starboard quarter, the lookout forward
reports,” said Raymond, hailing the captain from the
main deck.</p>

<p>“All right: we heard it here,” replied O’Hara. “Is
it a gun, or a bell? Report if you hear it again, Mr.
Raymond.”</p>

<p>“If it was a bell, it may be the other vessels of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
fleet. If it was a gun, it was not fired by the Josephine
or the Tritonia, for the reason that neither of them has
a gun to fire.”</p>

<p>“I hear it again; and I am sure it is a bell,” exclaimed
Tom Speers.</p>

<p>“Whisht! Wait till you hear another; for the two
schooners are together, and when one rings the other
will, you may be sure,” added the captain, not a little
excited.</p>

<p>But no other stroke of a bell was heard for a little
time.</p>

<p>“I know the sound of the Tritonia’s bell; and it
isn’t she,” said O’Hara. “It is a much heavier bell
we hear.”</p>

<p>All hands listened again.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV.<br>

<small>THE WRECK OF THE CASTLE WILLIAM.</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE sound of the bell was heard again in a few
minutes. It had a heavy and dull tone, unlike
that of the bells of the schooners. All hands on the
Ville d’Angers listened attentively to the sound.</p>

<p>“I think it must be the bell of one of the consorts,”
said Capt. O’Hara, when he had heard the bell at least
a dozen times.</p>

<p>“It don’t sound like the bell of the Tritonia,” replied
Tom Speers, after he had heard it once more. “And
all the sounds are from the same bell. If the two
schooners were off in that direction, we should hear the
bells of both of them.”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what it is: the fog makes the difference
in the sound from what we are accustomed to
hear. We never heard the bell except when we were
on the deck where it was rung. It stands to reason
that it would be another thing when heard at a distance,
and in a thick fog,” continued the captain, who
wished the sound might come from the consorts, and
was influenced by his desire.</p>

<p>The sound seemed to be a long way off; and the
captain said it bothered him to know how they happened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
to hear it when it was so far off. He called Mr.
Shakings and Capt. Fairfield, and asked them to give
their opinion in regard to the tones of the bell. They
did not think it was the bell of the Josephine, to which
they were more accustomed to listen on board; but it
might be, for bells sounded different under varying
circumstances. At last O’Hara decided to run for the
sound of the bell, and directed the officer of the deck
to change the course to north, for this was the direction
from which the sound came.</p>

<p>Capt. O’Hara could not reconcile himself to the
sound of the bell; but he thought, as had been suggested,
that the condition of the atmosphere might alter
the tone of the Tritonia’s bell. He concluded that the
schooners had fallen off their course as the wind veered,
and the Ville d’Angers had run ahead of them. This
was the only explanation he could give; and, in the absence
of a better one, it satisfied him for the time. The
firemen did their duty now, though Shakings showed
himself to them once in a while so that they need not
forget him.</p>

<p>Every thing seemed to be going well on board, and a
sharp lookout was kept for the rest of the fleet ahead.
The bell to the northward sounded more and more
distinctly as the steamer advanced; and the nearer she
came to it, the louder it sounded.</p>

<p>“That can’t be the bell of the Tritonia,” said Tom
Speers, as he met the captain on the poop-deck.</p>

<p>“Begorra, I don’t believe it is!” exclaimed O’Hara,
in whose mind the question had been raised anew.
“Upon my sowl, it is big enough for a church-bell; and
we have come nearer to it than we were when we first
heard it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>“It must be some other vessel,” added Speers. “It
isn’t a steamer, or she would whistle in such a fog as
this.”</p>

<p>“No: sure it’s not a steamer; and what the blazes is
it?” queried the captain, very much puzzled. “I hope
we shall not miss the rest of the fleet.”</p>

<p>“I hope not; but, if the schooners stood down to the
southward, we have very little chance of seeing them
again, unless this fog lifts soon,” replied Speers.</p>

<p>“Have you seen Gregory and Clinch since the ship’s
company was stationed?” asked O’Hara, suddenly
changing the topic of the conversation, though he did
not cease to peer into the dense fog ahead.</p>

<p>“Neither of them has been on deck since the second
part of the starboard watch took the deck,” answered
Speers.</p>

<p>“Where are they?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. They went into the cabin, and I
suppose they are there now. They have a state-room
together.”</p>

<p>“I don’t quite like the conduct of Gregory, who is
the first officer,” added O’Hara, in a low tone. “He
took the trouble to tell me he did not approve the
arrangement of the watches as I had made it.”</p>

<p>“I dare say he will assent to it,” added Tom. “I
don’t know him at all, and never served in the same
vessel with him.”</p>

<p>“He used to be a mighty hard boy at the time he
was in the steerage of the Young America; but when
he got into the Josephine, he reformed; and Mr. Fluxion
believes he has made a man of him. Perhaps he
has: I don’t know. If he has, there has been a big
change in him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>“Let us hope he will be a good officer while he is on
board of the steamer.”</p>

<p>“Certainly we will hope so; but it was a bad beginning
for him to object to the arrangement of the
watches before he had been on board two hours.”</p>

<p>“What does he object to?” asked Tom Speers; and
he was willing to believe there might be something
wrong about the arrangement, for it would not be at
all strange if a mistake had been made.</p>

<p>Tom thought it might be possible that his friend the
captain had been just a little “airy” in his dealings
with the two officers from the Josephine, though he had
never noticed any thing of the kind in O’Hara while
they had been together in the steamer. Such an
exhibition would not be very remarkable in a young
man, placed in command of a steamer with the arbitrary
control of thirty of his companions. He was
determined to caution his friend in regard to the manifestation
of any thing that could be construed into an
overbearing or domineering spirit. He knew very well
from experience, that such an appearance would excite
opposition, if there was none in the beginning.</p>

<p>“What does he object to?” repeated O’Hara. “He
says he objects to the arrangement of the watches.”</p>

<p>“What did you say to him?” asked Tom curiously,
if not anxiously.</p>

<p>“I only told him I was sorry he didn’t like it,” replied
the captain, smiling, as though he thought he had
answered the complaint very properly.</p>

<p>“Did he say any thing more?”</p>

<p>“Yes, he did: he added that he didn’t think there
was any need of quarter-watches,” chuckled O’Hara;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
“and Clinch took the trouble to say he didn’t think so
either: as if he considered it important that I should
know the first and third officer were of the same mind
on the subject.”</p>

<p>O’Hara talked and chuckled and laughed like one
who felt that he occupied a strong position. He was
quite happy over it; for, if there was to be any trouble
on board, he was altogether in the right, and the other
party all in the wrong.</p>

<p>“What did you say then?” inquired Tom Speers,
desiring to know whether or not there was any foundation
for his fears and suspicion.</p>

<p>“I told them that showed we differed in opinion a
little taste; and I smiled as swately as though I was
spaking to Miss Louise in the cabin below. And that
reminds me to say I think the girl is a little swate on
you, Tom, my boy, since you pulled her out of the say,”
said the captain, getting excited as he proceeded, and
relapsing into his Irish brogue.</p>

<p>“Never mind the girl,” added Tom impatiently,
though he blushed a little as he turned away to wipe
off the dampness that had gathered on his face from
the fog. “I am not one of your romantic pups who
think a girl ought to be his wife because he has
rendered her some little service.”</p>

<p>“Faix, it was no little service you rendered her; for
she was sure to be drowned if you hadn’t got to her
with the life-buoy as soon as you did.”</p>

<p>“Never mind that now, Capt. O’Hara,” interposed
the young hero.</p>

<p>“Oh! you are not on duty now; and you needn’t
measure off your words into lengths with me just now,”
said O’Hara, with a laugh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>“Do you think Gregory is discontented?” asked
Tom.</p>

<p>“If his words come from his heart, he is; but that
is his fault,” replied the captain very lightly. “If he
don’t like the arrangement of the watches, he can’t help
himself; for I am the commander of this ship.”</p>

<p>“Excuse me, O’Hara, as I am not on duty just now,
if I speak to you as a friend.”</p>

<p>“Certainly, my boy: blaze away! I won’t put you in
irons for any thing you may say now,” added O’Hara
curiously; for he had not the least idea that he had
done any thing wrong, or even out of taste.</p>

<p>“Don’t you think it would have been better if you
had answered Gregory and Clinch in a little different
way?”</p>

<p>“What do you mane? Wasn’t I civil to them?
Didn’t I smile as sweetly upon them as though they
hadn’t raised a ghost of an objection to the watches?”</p>

<p>“Of course you are the captain, and you were not
obliged to make any explanations; but don’t you think
it would have been better if you had been a little more
conciliatory toward Gregory and Clinch, even if they
were a little wrong?” asked Tom.</p>

<p>“Faix, I don’t know: I didn’t think of that,” repeated
O’Hara thoughtfully. “They supposed it was my
arrangement they were objecting to all the time, when
it was the orders of the senior vice-principal himself.”</p>

<p>“So much the worse, if they thought the plan was
your own,” added Tom.</p>

<p>“Well, now, I thought it was so much the better!”
exclaimed the captain.</p>

<p>“So much the better for you, but so much the worse<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
for Gregory and Clinch,” continued Tom. “Possibly
the first officer thought you ought to have consulted
with him about the arrangement of the watches. All
I mean to say is, that it would have been more magnanimous
to have told Gregory, when he objected, that you
were only carrying out the orders of the vice-principal.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you are right, Tom, my darling,” added
O’Hara, musing.</p>

<p>“It was not in the midst of an emergency, O’Hara;
and he did not refuse to obey orders. If he had, and
you had knocked him down, it would have been all
right. It is only fair to let the first and third officers
know, if they object to any thing, that they are kicking
against the senior vice-principal, and not against you,”
continued Tom, as sagely as though he was a fit judge
to settle a case between his captain and an officer
above himself.</p>

<p>“That’s all very well; and I think you are right this
time, Tom, if you never were before,” answered O’Hara.
“But am I to make a distinction between the enforcement
of my own orders and those of the powers
above me? If I tell the officer of the deck, and it
happens to be Gregory or Clinch, to stop the engine,
am I to explain that this is the order of the senior vice-principal,
and not my own? or, if it should be my own,
to argue that it is all right?”</p>

<p>“Certainly not; nothing of the kind! I said in the
beginning that this was a matter of magnanimity, and
not of right. Your orders are to be obeyed without
a question on the part of any one on board; not even
Capt. Fairfield or Mr. Shakings having the right to
object.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>“I see: I understand you perfectly, Tom, my darlint;
and I am much obliged to you for the trouble you
have taken to say all this. Give me your flipper! I
like you betther than ever, if you are a millionnaire; for
it’s a good friend that will point out another’s
faults.”</p>

<p>“I don’t point out your faults, O’Hara. I am afraid,
if I were the commander of this steamer, I should be a
little ‘airy;’ and I was dreading lest you might be,
though, upon my honor, I haven’t seen any thing of the
kind in you.”</p>

<p>“It’s moighty aisy y’are on me, Tom; and I believe
I have been airy; but, upon my sowl, I’ll never do it
again! I like you better than if you had given me the
half of your three millions; and I wish you were the
captain of the steamer, instead of myself.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense, captain! You are ten times as fit to
command her as I am; and I am glad it is as it is.”</p>

<p>“Whisht!”</p>

<p>“Vessel dead ahead!” shouted the lookout, on the
jib-boom of the steamer, where the officer of the deck
had sent him when the bell began to be heard very
distinctly on the forecastle of the steamer.</p>

<p>The officer of the deck hastily repeated the cry, and
ordered the quartermaster to put the helm hard down.
At the same time he rushed into the pilot-house, and
rang the speed-bell for the engine to “slow down.”</p>

<p>“Can you make her out?” said the captain, gazing
into the dense fog ahead.</p>

<p>“I don’t see any thing; but we are more than a hundred
feet farther from the vessel than the man on the
forecastle.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>“I will go forward, then,” added O’Hara, suiting the
action to the words.</p>

<p>Tom Speers saw Gregory and Clinch come out of
the cabin, and follow the captain forward, and he concluded
to remain where he was; for he was off duty,
and he did not care to have the other officers of the
steamer regard him as the adviser of the captain, if the
commander asked him any questions.</p>

<p>The Ville d’Angers slowed down in obedience to
the will of the assistant engineer in charge. If the
lookout had been less vigilant, the steamer would have
struck the vessel ahead square on the broadside, and
that would have been the end of her. But Raymond,
as the officer of the deck, was always exceedingly careful;
and he had spent most of his time at the heel of
the bowsprit since the position of the craft was clearly
indicated by the sound of the bell. The whistle had
been sounded on the steamer at short intervals; and, as
it came nearer, the bell was rung more vigorously, so
that each vessel had a clear idea of the position of the
other.</p>

<p>Gregory and Clinch went forward behind the captain,
and they could not help being considerably excited over
the prospect of some sort of an adventure. But they
said nothing to O’Hara; and it was evident from their
actions that they were a little “disgruntled.”</p>

<p>“I believe O’Hara has lost his wits,” said Gregory,
in a prudently low tone. “It beats me to know what
he is chasing this vessel for, running some miles off the
course.”</p>

<p>“I suppose he thought that bell belonged to one of
the schooners,” added Clinch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>“It sounds more like one of the bells of the churches
of Paris than it does like the Josephine’s; and he might
have known that it did not belong to one of the
schooners,” growled the first officer.</p>

<p>The captain had certainly allowed the Ville d’Angers
to continue on her course to the northward after he
and Tom Speers were reasonably confident that the
bell did not indicate the presence of the other vessels
of the fleet. Possibly O’Hara’s curiosity had been
excited, and he wished to see the vessel that rang the
heavy bell; but it is more likely, that, in the conversation
which ensued, he had forgotten for the moment
that the vessel ahead could not be either of those for
which he was in search. He desired to satisfy himself,
after he had gone so far to the north,—only a few
miles, however,—that the bell was not on either of the
vessels, and that they had not run off in this direction.
By sweeping off a little to the westward, on his return,
he might fall into hearing distance of their bells or
horns.</p>

<p>“Do you make her out, Mr. Raymond?” asked
O’Hara, as he ascended to the top-gallant forecastle.</p>

<p>“Distinctly, sir,” replied the officer of the deck.</p>

<p>“What is she?”</p>

<p>“It seems to be a wreck, with a number of persons
on board of her. All her masts have been carried
away; she has a square sail rigged on a jury-mast, and
is running before the wind,” added Raymond, as he
made out the details he mentioned.</p>

<p>“I see her now,” continued O’Hara, as he traced
the outline of the vessel through the dense mass of fog
which covered the sea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>“We are running by her, sir,” said Raymond. “Shall
I stop her?”</p>

<p>“Stop and back her,” replied the captain.</p>

<p>“Ring one bell!” shouted the officer of the deck.</p>

<p>“One bell!” responded the quartermaster in the
pilot-house; and he rang it.</p>

<p>“Ring two bells!” added Raymond.</p>

<p>“Two bells!” repeated the man in charge of the
wheel; and, when he rang them, the screw began to
turn backwards.</p>

<p>“Stop her!” said O’Hara, when he judged that her
headway was overcome.</p>

<p>“Ring one bell!” added Raymond.</p>

<p>“One bell, sir!” echoed the quartermaster; and the
engine stopped.</p>

<p>While this was done on board of the steamer, the
hands on the wreck let go the halyard of the square
sail, and it came down on the deck. The hulk was
moving so slowly that it forged only a little ahead of
the Ville d’Angers, leaving her on the weather quarter
of the deck. From the top-gallant forecastle of the
steamer, the officers had a tolerably clear view of the
dismasted vessel, which might have been a ship or a
barque, for the stumps of her three masts could be
distinctly seen. She was painted green, and looked
like a very old vessel, for her bow was as stunt-built as
the craft of a hundred years ago.</p>

<p>“Hail her, Mr. Raymond, and let us ascertain what
we can of her,” said Capt. O’Hara.</p>

<p>“Ship ahoy!” shouted the officer of the deck,
through the speaking-trumpet which had been supplied
by Mr. Fluxion; for this instrument meant twice as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
much to him as to any other officer in the squadron.</p>

<p>“On board the steamer!” replied a man on the
deck of the hulk.</p>

<p>“What vessel is that?”</p>

<p>“The ship Castle William, from Calcutta to Portsmouth,
with invalid troops!” yelled the man on the
deck of the wreck; and there seemed to be not more
than three men on duty there.</p>

<p>“Tell him we will send a boat on board,” said the
captain; and Raymond repeated the words.</p>

<p>“Don’t do it!” shouted the man earnestly. “We
have small-pox and typhoid-fever on board.”</p>

<p>“Phew! here’s a nice kettle of fish!” exclaimed
O’Hara.</p>

<p>“Keep to windward, and come a little nearer!”
called the spokesman of the wreck.</p>

<p>The captain gave the necessary orders to back the
Ville d’Angers, and run up a little nearer to the wreck.
Taking the suggestion of the man on the hulk, he
thought there would not be any danger in going to
windward of her.</p>

<p>“Do you hear that, Clinch?” said Gregory, with no
little excitement in his manner. “There is small-pox
and typhoid-fever on board of that wreck; and O’Hara
is going to get nearer to her.”</p>

<p>“I don’t like the idea,” added Clinch.</p>

<p>“Capt. O’Hara, I protest against going any nearer
to that vessel!” said Gregory, walking up to the captain,
and touching his cap as he spoke. “She has
contagious diseases on board of her; and we shall all
take them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>“There is no danger, I think, while we keep well to
windward of her. The breeze is pretty fresh, and I
don’t believe the disease can travel up against it,”
replied O’Hara, mindful of what had passed between
Tom Speers and himself, though he was at first inclined
to make no reply to the protest.</p>

<p>“I don’t think it is safe: I protest, and insist that
the steamer be put on her course to the Madeiras!”
added Gregory, in a very offensive manner.</p>

<p>“Shall we abandon this wreck, without even ascertaining
whether or not she needs any assistance?”
demanded O’Hara, with some indignation in his tones.</p>

<p>“You need not go any nearer to her, at any rate,”
replied Gregory, somewhat shaken by this argument;
for all the students had been thoroughly schooled in
the lesson of humanity, that every sailor was bound to
assist every other sailor in distress.</p>

<p>The captain made no further reply to the first officer.
Possibly he did not run the steamer as near to the
wreck, for he directed the course, as he might have
done if Gregory had said nothing.</p>

<p>The Ville d’Angers was stopped on the quarter of
the wreck, and at about half a cable’s length from it.</p>

<p>“How many have you on board?” asked O’Hara,
taking the trumpet from the officer of the deck.</p>

<p>“Thirty-two,” replied the spokesman of the wreck.</p>

<p>“Are you the captain?”</p>

<p>“No; he is down with fever: I am the mate.”</p>

<p>“How many sick have you?”</p>

<p>“All but three men,—myself and two seamen. Five
of the crew have died, and eight are sick.”</p>

<p>It appeared from the answers of the mate, that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
Castle William had left Calcutta with a crew of sixteen,
including the officers. She had in her steerage twenty-one
disabled soldiers, among whom the typhoid-fever
had broken out after she left St. Helena, where she
had put in for supplies. At this place she had received
a sailor to work his passage; and, when the ship had
been out a week, he was taken down with the small-pox.
They had made a place for him in the head; but
five of the crew had already died with this disease and
the fever. Six more were sick with the fever, and two
with the small-pox.</p>

<p>Certainly it was a terrible state of things on board
of the wreck, which had been short-handed, and was
thrown on her beam-ends in the recent gale, or hurricane
the mate called it. The three men had cut away
the masts, and this had righted her.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV.<br>

<small>A CHANGE OF DESTINATION.</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">MR. FRISBONE had gone down into the fire-room
as soon as the order was given to slow down, in
order to see that the firemen did not do any mischief
to the boilers or engine by too much firing while the
steam was not used. But the men seemed to be very
well disposed, and had opened the furnace-doors when
the engineer on duty gave the order. The spare steam
was blowing off at the same time. As the Prince was
thus engaged in preventing a catastrophe in the engine-
or fire-room, he did not learn the condition of things
on board of the Castle William till the captain sent for
him and for all the adult officers on board of the Ville
d’Angers. It was a desperate case which the young
officers were called upon to settle; and O’Hara was
disposed to take the advice of all that were older and
wiser than himself.</p>

<p>“Do you need assistance?” asked O’Hara, after he
had sent for the adult portion of the ship’s company.
But it seemed like a foolish question to ask; for here
was a dismasted hulk, on board of which were thirty-two
human beings, all but three of whom were disabled.
There were not well ones enough to take care<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
of the sick, to say nothing of handling the vessel. If
left to themselves, they must all miserably perish in a
few days, for the storms of the Bay of Biscay would
soon make an end of the unmanageable hulk. Of
course she needed assistance; and it would be inhuman
in the last degree to refuse it.</p>

<p>“We need assistance very badly,” replied the mate
of the Castle William. “We must all die of disease or
go to the bottom, without it.”</p>

<p>“Do you need provisions and stores?” inquired
O’Hara.</p>

<p>“We have provisions enough, but we want fresh
vegetables and stores for the sick.”</p>

<p>“We will send you what we have,” replied the young
captain. “What else do you want?”</p>

<p>“We can never get into port on this wreck. She has
a very valuable cargo in the hold.”</p>

<p>“Do you wish for more seamen?”</p>

<p>“If we had a hundred men, they could hardly save
the ship if it came on heavy weather. Will you tow
the wreck into port?” asked the mate; and this last
request was evidently what he had desired to reach from
the beginning.</p>

<p>“We will consider it,” replied Capt. O’Hara, not a
little startled at the request.</p>

<p>“Our sick people are well provided for; and this is
the best thing you can do for us. You will make a
good thing by it.”</p>

<p>By this time the Prince, Capt. Fairfield, and the adult
forward officers, had gathered in the pilot-house for
consultation. O’Hara stated the situation of the wreck
and the people on board of it. He laid before the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
council all the information he had obtained from the
mate of the Castle William; but he expressed no opinion
or desire on his own part. He wished to hear the
opinion of his elders before he gave his own.</p>

<p>Mr. Frisbone listened very attentively to the statement
of the captain; and he did not speak a word till
O’Hara had said all he had to say.</p>

<p>“I want your advice,” continued the captain. “Of
course it was not supposed, when I was placed in
command of the Ville d’Angers, that I should be called
upon to settle such big questions as this one.”</p>

<p>“But I have faith to believe that you would settle it
right,” added the Prince. “There is only one thing to
be done in a case like this; and all the lawyers and
doctors of divinity in the world couldn’t make our
duty any plainer to us; and that is, to relieve the distressed,
and at any cost of labor and trouble.”</p>

<p>“That’s the talk!” shouted the impulsive and warm-hearted
Shakings, bringing his fist down upon the wheel
with force enough to break his bones or split the wood.
“Your honor is a sailor at heart, if you never did come
in at the hawse-hole, and feel your way to the quarter-deck!”</p>

<p>So said Rimmer in his slower and more heavy tones.</p>

<p>“But there will be great risk in exposing the young
gentlemen to small-pox and ship-fever,” suggested
Capt. Fairfield: not that he intended to object to the
performance of a humane duty, but because he desired
to have both sides of the question considered; and
there were thirty-one young lives to be cared for, as
well as thirty-two older ones.</p>

<p>“I think we ought to save a fellow-creetur from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
death when the risk of losing our own lives is no
greater than the chance of saving them that’s in danger,”
replied the Prince emphatically. “That’s my
doctrine!”</p>

<p>“Your honor was cut out for a sailor; and you
missed your calling, that you are not now in command
of the finest ship afloat!” exclaimed Shakings, with
enthusiasm.</p>

<p>“That’s all gammon, Mr. What’s-your-name,” said
the Prince.</p>

<p>“My name is Shakings.”</p>

<p>“I should think it might be; but do you suppose
all the good feeling and humanity in the world belong
to sailors?” demanded the Prince. “That’s only the
shakings of a bad logic.”</p>

<p>“Your honor proves that the sailors haven’t all the
good feeling in the world.”</p>

<p>“If you are an American citizen, don’t call any man
‘your honor,’ unless it is the judge on the bench. You
are getting things mixed up with them lords and dooks
on this side of the ocean,” continued the Prince reproachfully.
“I call myself an American Prince; and
I don’t eat dirt before any man, and I don’t like to
see other princes do it.”</p>

<p>“It is the first duty of an American sailor to be respectful
to his betters; and I use the lingo I learned,
because I am in the habit of doing so when I see a
man do a handsome thing, as your honor always does,”
said Shakings with a laugh.</p>

<p>“This is neither here nor there; only I don’t like
to see any flunkying at any time. We are called upon to
give some advice to the captain; though, in my opinion,
he don’t need any.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>“I believe we are giving it; and I suppose he understands
what we all think about it by this time,” continued
Shakings.</p>

<p>“If I comprehend the views of Capt. Fairfield, he
objects to rendering assistance in the present instance,
as it would expose our ship’s company to these contagious
diseases,” added the captain, turning to the instructor
of the Ville d’Angers.</p>

<p>“By no means!” protested Capt. Fairfield warmly.
“I should feel guilty to the end of my life if we should
leave these poor people to perish without giving them
all the aid in our power.”</p>

<p>Shakings thought the instructor had spoken like a
“sodger” before; and his present speech was more
like that of a sailor.</p>

<p>“Then there appears to be no disagreement among
you, gentlemen,” added Capt. O’Hara. “I agree with
you that the people on the wreck ought to be relieved.”</p>

<p>“Spoken like a true sailor!” ejaculated Shakings.</p>

<p>“Or like a true soldier!” exclaimed the Prince.</p>

<p>“Thank you, Mr. Frisbone; and I won’t stop to tell
you what soldiers have done a thousand times for those
in distress,” added Capt. Fairfield.</p>

<p>“We are to assist the people on the wreck,” interposed
the captain. “How, and to what extent, is the
next question.—Mr. Raymond, keep the whistle going
every five minutes.”</p>

<p>“We are doing so, sir,” replied the officer of the
deck, who was planking the forecastle.</p>

<p>O’Hara stated that the sufferers on the wreck
needed no provisions, only fresh vegetables and comforts
for the sick. As the steamer was abundantly provided<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
with the former, it was promptly decided to send
all that could be spared of them. As to comforts for
the sick, which they understood to include medicines,
the Prince declared that he would consult his wife, who
was one of the best nurses in the world, and had saved
his life when the doctors gave him up, by her intelligent
care. The benevolent gentleman was on the point of
starting for the cabin, when the captain interposed.</p>

<p>“We have not settled the worst and hardest question
of the whole, Mr. Frisbone,” said O’Hara. “I have an
opinion on the subject; but I wish for your advice.”</p>

<p>“What on airth comes now?” demanded the Prince,
closing the door he had opened.</p>

<p>Since his wife had become Mrs. Frisbone, and they
had crossed the ocean, she had been doing her best to
improve the grammar and pronunciation of the Prince;
and she had succeeded wonderfully well, considering
the hard subject she had to deal with. He talked tolerably
well under ordinary circumstances; but when he
was dealing with a great question, or became very much
excited, it was observable that he relapsed into nearly
all his old barbarisms of speech.</p>

<p>“The mate of the Castle William wishes the steamer
to tow the wreck into port,” added O’Hara.</p>

<p>“Into port!” exclaimed the Prince.</p>

<p>“He does not say what port; but the ship was
bound to Portsmouth, England.”</p>

<p>“Where is that?” asked the Prince, whose geography
was sometimes at fault.</p>

<p>“It is close by Southampton.”</p>

<p>“That’s not the nearest port?”</p>

<p>“By no means. We are not more than three hundred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
nautical miles from Lisbon; and about the same
from Cadiz.”</p>

<p>“I expect, with those diseases on board, that the
Spaniards, the Portuguese, or even the English at Gibraltar,
would keep the people on the wreck in quarantine
for about forty days; and the chances are that
most of them would never see England again,” said
Mr. Rimmer.</p>

<p>“How far is it to Southampton?” asked the Prince.</p>

<p>O’Hara went to the chart-room, measured off the distance,
and returned to the pilot-house.</p>

<p>“I make it about twelve hundred miles,” he said, as
he joined the circle.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe in taking this steamer into a French
or Spanish port,” added the Prince. “I think that
as much as one-half of her belongs to the academy
squadron, as salvage; and a port in England is the
best place to have the business properly fixed up.”</p>

<p>“The mate of the Castle William says she has a
valuable cargo in her hold; and I suppose we shall be
entitled to salvage in her,” suggested the captain.</p>

<p>“Of course you will; and I don’t think Mr. Lowington
will lose any thing if we should take the wreck to—that
place you mentioned.”</p>

<p>“Portsmouth.”</p>

<p>No one objected to this business view of the situation;
and it was in council agreed, that it would be
expedient to tow the wreck to Portsmouth in preference
to any port on the Spanish peninsula.</p>

<p>“I am confident that if Mr. Lowington or Mr.
Fluxion were here, he would send the steamer to England
with the wreck,” said Mr. Shakings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>“But I desire to do all I can to find the consorts
before we do any thing,” interposed O’Hara. “When
that is done, I am willing to act on my own responsibility,
with your advice.”</p>

<p>“There is no let-up in the fog,” added Mr. Rimmer,
as he took a long look on all sides of the steamer.</p>

<p>It was decided to wait till it could be ascertained
whether or not the Josephine and the Tritonia were
anywhere in the vicinity. The boatswain and the carpenter
were instructed to fire the gun, which the Prince
had used so effectually on the night of the collision,
every thirty minutes during the rest of the day, or until
the fog cleared off. The first gun was discharged
immediately. At the moment of the report, the quartermaster
struck eight bells in the pilot-house; and it
was repeated on the great bell forward.</p>

<p>“All the port-watch on deck!” shouted the acting
boatswain’s mate, as he piped the call through the ship.</p>

<p>It was the first dog-watch; and the first part of the
port-watch had the deck for one hour. It was in
charge of Gregory; and Raymond gave him the orders
he had received, and handed him the trumpet as the
indication of his authority. But there was nothing
to do on board, except to keep a sharp lookout, and to
give the fog-signals.</p>

<p>The stewards had been directed to get out the vegetables
to be sent to the wreck; and they were attending
to this duty. About a dozen boxes of onions,
turnips, and potatoes, and a smaller variety of other
vegetables, were now in readiness at the gangway to be
conveyed to the Castle William. In the mean time
the American Prince had gone into the cabin to consult<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
his wife in regard to the needs of the sick on board
of the vessel.</p>

<p>Mrs. Frisbone had been seasick for several days;
but she had now completely recovered. The motion of
the steamer, even while she was hove to, was quite
easy; and the lady was sitting at the table in the after-cabin,
as the part in the stern which was separated
from the rest by the curtain was called. Miss Rodwood
was at her side; and both of them listened with
the deepest interest to the story of the Prince.</p>

<p>“I want you to see about getting together some
things to send to these poor people,” said the Prince,
when he had finished his narrative. “Perhaps you
can tell what medicines they need, and get them out of
the chist.”</p>

<p>“I will get them out of the chest”—</p>

<p>“Out of the chest, and not out of the chist,” added
Mr. Frisbone, with a laugh. “I suppose we ought to
let ’em all die while we make the chist into a chest.”</p>

<p>“Not so bad as that; but chist is particularly bad
pronunciation. I cannot tell what the sick sailors and
soldiers need in the way of medicines without seeing
them,” protested the lady.</p>

<p>“But they are all sick with contagious diseases!”
exclaimed the Prince.</p>

<p>“I have had the small-pox, and I am not afraid of
that. I have taken care of many people who were
sick with the typhoid-fever, of which ship-fever is only
another form. I will go on board of the ship, and do
all I can for the poor creatures,” replied Mrs. Frisbone
earnestly.</p>

<p>“You, my dear?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>“I never yet shrunk from doing my duty, and I
shall not now,” added the lady.</p>

<p>“I will go with you, sister!” exclaimed Miss Rodwood.</p>

<p>“You will not expose her to these diseases?” demanded
Mr. Frisbone, not a little alarmed at the proposition.</p>

<p>“I cannot prevent her from doing a duty which is as
binding upon her as it is upon me,” replied Mrs. Frisbone,
with a sort of solemnity that greatly impressed
her husband.</p>

<p>“Very well; and I shall go with you,” continued the
benevolent American noble. “If it is your duty,—and
I don’t dispute that it is,—it is as much mine, and
I shall share it with you. But we must not expose any
of these boys to the contagion. I wouldn’t have one
of them catch the small-pox or the ship-fever for a
million dollars. I haven’t any thing in particular to do
on board of this vessel; and I can just as well be on
board of the other, doing what I can to make the sick
comfortable.”</p>

<p>The adults and the officers were astonished when
the decision of the Frisbone party was announced.
Capt. Fairfield and O’Hara did their best to reason
them out of the purpose; but that was useless. Mrs.
Frisbone declared that God had given her this duty to
perform, and she should be recreant to her trust if she
failed to do it. This was her opportunity to do the
will of Heaven; and she could no more neglect it than
she could refuse her daily bread.</p>

<p>“If I take any disease, and die, I shall die at the
post of duty; and I should be afraid to die anywhere<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
else,” said the heroic woman; “and I shall not have
lived in vain. Louise can do as she pleases. I do not
ask her or my husband to go with me.”</p>

<p>“But Miss Rodwood has been an invalid, and it will
be a pretty severe experience for her to act as a nurse
on board of a mere hulk, taking care of soldiers and
sailors,” said Capt. Fairfield.</p>

<p>“Perhaps it is just the experience my sister needs;
and it may prove to be a blessing to her,” replied Mrs.
Frisbone. “If she can put her whole mind to this
humane task, I am sure it will be a benefit to her.”</p>

<p>The lady evidently had views of her own on this
subject; and, as it appeared that her sister’s mind was
somewhat affected, it was possible that she understood
the case better than any other person.</p>

<p>The next thing was to get the devoted party on
board of the wreck without exposing any of the students
to the danger of infection. O’Hara studied the
case, and talked it over with the carpenter and boatswain.
It was not prudent to board the Castle William
on the weather side, for the sea would be likely to
stave the boat against her sides. If it went to leeward,
the crew of the boat would be exposed to the peril of
the pestilential air from the ship. At last it was decided
that none of the students should go in the boat
that conveyed the passengers and stores. The Prince,
the adult forward officers, and one of the stewards,
were to act as oarsmen. The stores were sent first; and
they were hoisted by the three well men on board of
the ship. The ladies who had been so unwilling to be
lowered in a boat when the object was to save their
own lives were let down into the cutter in a sling; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
they were safely hoisted on board of the Castle William.
The boat returned with all its crew except the
Prince.</p>

<p>The Ville d’Angers then ran off a considerable distance
from the wreck, as far as she could and not lose
sight of it. It was very quiet on deck and in the cabin.
The vessel was rolling in the sea, and there was nothing
to be done but to wait for the fog to lift. Gregory,
the officer of the deck, was like a monarch without a
kingdom; and when Clinch came in his way, he insisted
that it was dull music.</p>

<p>The steamer had been turned head to the sea, and
the screw was revolved just enough to keep the vessel
from drifting upon the Castle William. When she was
in danger of losing sight of the wreck, the engine was
stopped for a time. But the quartermaster attended to
all this business, and to the sounding of the whistle.</p>

<p>“I wish I was back in the Josephine again,” said
Gregory when he met Clinch.</p>

<p>“Why so? This isn’t a bad craft to be on board
of,” replied the third officer.</p>

<p>“This steamer is officered by about all the Tritonia’s
fellows,” growled Gregory. “Those that came from
the Josephine are mere ciphers. O’Hara hasn’t spoken
a word to me since we made out that wreck; and
I am the first officer of the steamer.”</p>

<p>Clinch did not say any thing; but he thought the
captain had not much encouragement to consult his
first officer, who had done nothing but object and protest
when he did any thing.</p>

<p>“I suppose he had made up his plan; but he hasn’t
said any thing to me about it,” continued Gregory.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
“He has put the Frisbones on board of the wreck, and
sent off all the vegetables we had on board. We may
get the scurvy for the want of them. Now we are as
fast here as though we were aground.”</p>

<p>“What are we waiting for?” asked Clinch.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. Don’t I keep saying the captain
don’t tell me what is going on?” snarled Gregory, as
though he were anxious to find a sufficient cause for
getting up a mutiny.</p>

<p>And so the day wore away. In the evening the fog
lifted; but nothing could be seen of the two schooners,
for they were far on their way to Madeira. But O’Hara
was not quite satisfied to undertake such an enterprise
as had been agreed upon, until it was no longer possible
to confer with the vice-principals of the squadron.
As the night was clear, he decided to run for three
hours to the south-west, and return if he found nothing
of the rest of the fleet. At midnight, when the steamer
was over forty miles from the Castle William, nothing
could be seen of the lights of the Josephine and Tritonia;
and, very unwillingly, he ordered the Ville d’Angers
to be headed to the north-east. After a run of
less than three hours, the wreck was readily found, for
lights were exhibited on board as before she lost her
masts. Raymond, who was in charge of the deck of
the Ville d’Angers, hailed the wreck, and was answered
by Mr. Frisbone. The wind was freshening, but the
sea was tolerably smooth.</p>

<p>O’Hara was still up, though he had taken a little
nap, and directed the steamer to be run as close as
possible to the hulk; and a small line was heaved to
her deck by Shakings. With this the heavy hawser of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
the ship was drawn over the stern of the steamer, where
it was made fast. While the boatswain was attending
to the securing of the hawser, O’Hara and the Prince
had some talk about the condition of the sick. They
were all comfortable; and Mrs. Frisbone had worked
out a revolution in the state of things between decks.
The captain laughed when the Prince said he had been
at work whitewashing since he came on board.</p>

<p>When the hawser was ready, O’Hara gave the order
to go ahead; and the steamer started on her voyage to
England.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVI.<br>

<small>THE WINE-ROOM OF THE VILLE D’ANGERS.</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE VILLE D’ANGERS had been under way
hardly an hour when the quartermaster in the
pilot-house struck eight bells; and the first part of
the port-watch was called to relieve the second part
of the starboard. Gregory was the officer of this division,
as Raymond had been of the last.</p>

<p>“North, half east,” said Raymond, giving the course
to his successor in charge of the vessel.</p>

<p>“North, half east!” exclaimed Gregory; and though
it was his duty to repeat the course as it was given to
him, in order to prevent any mistake, it was not necessary
for him to say it with such a tone of disgust.</p>

<p>“That’s the course we have been running for the last
hour,” replied Raymond quietly. “The officer of the
deck will keep a sharp lookout for the tow.”</p>

<p>“For the tow?” queried Gregory, as the fourth officer
repeated the orders which were required to be
given to his successor in charge of the deck. “What
do you mean by the tow?”</p>

<p>“Of course you are aware that the steamer is towing
the hulk of the Castle William?”</p>

<p>“I was not aware of it,” answered Gregory. “When<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
I turned in at four bells last night, the steamer was
headed to the southward and westward.”</p>

<p>“We returned to the wreck before three, after an
unsuccessful search for the rest of the fleet. We took
the Castle William in tow; and now we are bound for
Portsmouth, England. If you were not informed in
regard to the movements of the steamer, I think you
were the only officer on board who was in the dark.”</p>

<p>Gregory and Clinch were jealous of the officers of
the Tritonia. They had begun to object in the first of
the cruise, and even before the steamer was under way.
They had kept out of sight of the other officers, and
had avoided the captain as far as they could. Gregory
had been in charge when the steamer started for the
south, after the fog lifted. O’Hara had tried to talk
with him; but he was so stiff and distant that the captain
gave it up, and allowed him to live within his own
shell. He had been relieved by Clinch at ten in the
evening; and the third officer was no more inclined to
be sociable than the first.</p>

<p>At midnight Speers had been called, and, as soon
as he took the trumpet, the course of the steamer had
been changed to the northward again. In the last half
of this watch, when Raymond had the deck, the wreck
had been taken in tow. The captain remained on deck
long enough to ascertain that the Ville d’Angers was
making ten knots an hour, with the ship in tow; and
he hoped in the morning to do even better than this.
Thus it turned out that Gregory and Clinch knew nothing
of the destination of the steamer.</p>

<p>Possibly Gregory was as much astonished as he pretended
to be, when Raymond told him the vessel was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
bound to England. He had certainly been ugly ever
since he came on board. It seemed to him in the beginning,
that O’Hara ignored him in re-organizing the
watches, and especially in not speaking to him about the
quarter-watches. But then, he was looking for a cause
of offence; and those who look for it are sure to find
it.</p>

<p>“Though I am the first officer of the steamer, I have
not been consulted about any thing,” replied Gregory,
in answer to Raymond’s remark.</p>

<p>“I do not know that any of the officers have been
consulted,” added Raymond, who did not like the attitude
of Gregory.</p>

<p>“I suppose I was ignored because I came from the
Josephine. The Tritonia’s officers seem to be in the
ascendant on board of this vessel,” continued Gregory,
in the most forbidding of tones.</p>

<p>“I don’t think it can make any difference what vessel
the officers came from.”</p>

<p>“Tell that to the marines! isn’t the captain hand
and glove with Speers, the second officer? Are they
not together all the time they can be?” demanded the
irate watch-officer.</p>

<p>“I think Speers has been consulted no more than
you or I have,” replied Raymond, moving away from
the pilot-house; for he saw that it was of no use to
argue the point with one so unreasonable as Gregory
showed himself to be.</p>

<p>“Hold on a minute, Mr. Raymond,” interposed the
discontented officer. “Do you think it is right for the
captain to disregard his orders, and take the steamer
to England?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>“The captain can answer that question for himself,
and I cannot answer it for him,” replied Raymond.
“All I have to do is to obey my orders.”</p>

<p>“Suppose he should take it into his head to run for
the South Sea Islands on a pleasure-excursion: should
you feel it to be your duty to obey orders without a
protest, and go with him?” demanded Gregory.</p>

<p>“The captain is not doing any thing of that sort,
and there is no need of answering conundrums,” replied
Raymond warmly. “This is a case of life and
death with thirty-two people on board of the wreck;
and it has been decided by the captain, after consultation
with all the adults on board, to tow the hulk to
Portsmouth.”</p>

<p>“But it is a thousand miles to England.”</p>

<p>“It is more than that; but, if it were three thousand,
I should obey orders all the same.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think we are justified in obeying orders
under such circumstances,” continued Gregory. “I
think Mr. Fluxion will blame you and me if we assist
in sailing the steamer off on this long voyage, when the
orders were to take the vessel to the Madeiras.”</p>

<p>“Of course you have a right to your own opinion,
Mr. Gregory,” added Raymond coldly. “Good-morning.”</p>

<p>The fourth officer left the pilot-house, where the conversation
had been carried on in the presence of the
quartermaster and the seaman who were steering the
steamer. He was sorry he had listened so long to
the malecontent; and, as he walked aft, he debated with
himself whether or not he ought to wake the captain,
and inform him of the mutinous sentiments uttered by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
the first officer. But Gregory had taken the trumpet,
and had not yet declined to obey the orders of the
captain as transmitted to him by his predecessor in
charge; and he concluded to say nothing that might
place him in the position of a tale-bearer. He turned
in; but, as he had had his full six hours of sleep, he
lay awake thinking of what Gregory had said to
him.</p>

<p>Gregory wanted to do something; and, by diligent
thinking, he had fully persuaded himself that the course
taken by Capt. O’Hara was all wrong. In the first
place, he was exposing the ship’s company to the perils
of contagion; and, in the second, he was disregarding
his orders to take the steamer to Madeira in the event
that she should part company with the schooners. He
concluded that these were the orders, though he had
not heard the senior vice-principal give the instructions
to the commander of the steamer.</p>

<p>“I think you are quite right, Mr. Gregory,” said the
quartermaster at the wheel, after Raymond had gone.
“If the truth were known, Capt. Fairfield is of the same
mind. I know the fellows from the Josephine don’t
like the idea of breathing the air from that floating
hospital for the next week or ten days; nor of going
off on a cruise two or three weeks, wherever Mr.
O’Hara or the Tritonia chooses to take them.”</p>

<p>Gregory listened to this long speech without saying a
word. The sentiments were his own; but they were
mutinous in their nature, and he ought to have reproved
the quartermaster for speaking to his superior
officer in such terms of the captain.</p>

<p>“How were we going when the log was heaved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
last?” asked the first officer, taking no notice of the
speech of the man at the wheel.</p>

<p>“Ten and a half, sir,” replied Stokes.</p>

<p>Gregory went aft, calling for the watch on the forecastle
to follow him, and heaved the log. To his astonishment,
the Ville d’Angers was making eleven
knots. The firemen were evidently doing their best.
He had heard Mr. Frisbone say that the steamer would
make fifteen knots under favorable circumstances, and
that she had done it most of the time before the collision.
At this rate she would be in Portsmouth in five
days. He looked at the hulk astern, and saw that she
carried the square sail she had rigged on the jury-mast,
and the wind was fresh enough to help her along a
knot or two an hour.</p>

<p>Gregory examined the tow-line, as he had been instructed
to do, and found it all right so far as he was
able to judge. When he had complied so far with the
routine of the vessel and with his orders, he went forward
to the engine-room. Alexander was on duty
there; and he was the only one of the Tritonia’s ship’s
company on the watch in charge of the steamer. Mr.
Fluxion and Mr. Pelham had agreed that officers and
seamen from each vessel should be in the same watch,
so far as it was practicable; and this arrangement
would remove any possible danger of quarrelling and
disagreement among the students from the different
craft. This had been done; but the rule could not be
applied to the engineers, for both of them belonged to
the Tritonia. But the “greasers,” one from each quarter,
belonged to the regular watch.</p>

<p>“Good-morning, Mr. Gregory,” said the chief engineer,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
with a yawn, as the first officer stepped into the
engine-room.</p>

<p>“Good-morning, Mr. Alexander,” replied Gregory
coldly, as he invariably spoke to all the officers of the
Tritonia. “You have on a big head of steam.”</p>

<p>“The firemen have done very well since I came on
watch,” answered the engineer, with another yawn.</p>

<p>He had not been careful to improve all his opportunities
for sleep, as a sailor should, and as the students
had learned to do when on regular duty, and had not
turned in till after ten o’clock in the evening; and he
had been called at twelve. In the force of engineers
the steamer was short-handed; and the watch was
changed at six and twelve, night and day; and this
bill had been adopted at the request of the engineers
themselves, so that they could find no fault with it.</p>

<p>“We are making eleven knots; and that’s high
speed for a steamer towing a six-hundred-ton ship,”
added Gregory, who was really sorry to find the engine
doing so well.</p>

<p>“So much the sooner this voyage will be over,” answered
Alexander; and then he yawned again, for he
had not slept more than those two hours out of the last
twenty-four.</p>

<p>“Why, don’t you like it?” asked Gregory, not a little
astonished to hear a Tritonian express even a hint
of being dissatisfied.</p>

<p>“I can’t say I do,” replied Alexander, with a heavy
gape; “at least, I have had about enough of it, as the
thing is going now. A fellow can’t stand it without
his sleep. I have to keep my eye on that gauge all the
time; and it is with the utmost difficulty that I can
keep my peepers open.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>Alexander gaped again, and Gregory seated himself
by his side.</p>

<p>“It is rather rough on you to serve these six-hour
watches,” added the first officer.</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t have minded it for a short cruise; but
I didn’t ship as an engineer for a trip to England and
back.”</p>

<p>“I suppose Richards likes it, don’t he?” Gregory
proceeded, anxious to obtain more information in regard
to the sentiments of the engineers.</p>

<p>“He is more discontented than I am. He is growling
all the time; and he was downright mad when he
learned that the recitations were to be carried on to-morrow,
just as they are in all the vessels of the squadron.
I shall be in a pretty condition to study my lessons,
after this watch is finished. I shall turn in as
soon as I get my breakfast, and sleep till noon, when I
have to take my place in the engine-room again. How
am I to keep up with the class, and run this machine
twelve hours a day?”</p>

<p>“You can’t do it, of course.”</p>

<p>“No more can Richards. He came within one of
slipping out of the cabin on the first of the month, when
Speers came in from the steerage; and he wants to
make his election sure next time.”</p>

<p>“It is a hard case for both of you. But I suppose
you volunteered for this duty?”</p>

<p>“Richards and I were the only fellows who knew
any thing about an engine, and we were really forced to
volunteer,” yawned Alexander. “I wish we were on
our way to Madeira, instead of on a trip to England.”</p>

<p>“What is the matter with these fellows down in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
fire-room?” asked Gregory, whose attention had been
attracted several times during the conversation, by the
singing and laughing of the men at the fires.</p>

<p>“They seem to be very jolly to-night for some reason
or other,” replied the engineer, gaping fearfully
as his drowsiness gained upon him.</p>

<p>The first officer wondered why the men were so jolly
at that early hour in the morning; and to satisfy himself
he went down into the fire-room. After he had
taken a few steps upon the iron stairs, he saw one of
the Frenchmen strike off the neck of a bottle with a
bar of iron. He poured the contents of the bottle into
several tin cups, and passed them to his companions,
retaining one for himself. The liquid was very red; and
the officer had no doubt it was claret wine, such as is
usually furnished to the passengers on board of French
steamers.</p>

<p>The men drank off the contents of the tin cups, and
then began to sing with renewed energy. It was the
quantity of wine they had drank, which made the men
so jolly. He was confident that it had not been furnished
by the officers or the stewards; and it was plain
enough that the foreigners had found it in the hold of
the vessel.</p>

<p>Gregory spoke French well enough to do his part in
carrying on an ordinary conversation in that language;
and, descending into the fire-room, he asked the Frenchmen
where they had obtained the wine. The men had
drank too much to be disturbed by any common event;
and they all laughed heartily at the question. The
three Frenchmen were on duty, and Pierre spoke for
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>“You are not the captain?” said he, looking the first
officer over from head to foot.</p>

<p>“No: I am the officer of the deck,” replied
Gregory.</p>

<p>“Plenty of wine in this vessel,” said Pierre, laughing
again as though he was the happiest mortal in
existence.</p>

<p>The other two men threw open the furnace-doors,
and began to shovel in the coal at a furious rate. But
the officer observed that they kept an eye on the draughts,
and used all the precautions against fire or injury to the
boilers, doubtless doing so from the sheer force of
habit.</p>

<p>“Where did you get the wine?” repeated Gregory,
as the fellow did not answer him.</p>

<p>“Very good wine!” exclaimed Pierre, taking another
bottle from one of the coal-bunkers, and breaking off
the neck as he had done before. “Try some of it;”
and he handed the bottle to the officer.</p>

<p>The first officer of the Ville d’Angers, though he had
been a good seaman and a good scholar for a considerable
time, was not one of the “chaplain’s lambs,” as
the good boys were called by the bad ones. He had
no conscientious or other scruples against drinking a
glass of wine, or even a bottle, as he had done when
the eyes of the professors were not upon him.</p>

<p>Gregory took the bottle; but he was not inclined to
drink out of the dirty tin cup of the firemen, or to cut
his lips with the glass of the broken bottle. The fireman
saw his difficulty, and then disappeared for a moment,
returning with a clean tumbler, which he had
evidently taken from the mess-room forward of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
engine on deck. He handed it to the officer with the
greatest show of deference and politeness. Gregory
filled the glass, and drank it off, though it was a heavy
dram for a young man of his years.</p>

<p>“Where did you get it?” asked the officer.</p>

<p>Instead of answering the question, Pierre took a lantern
which hung at the entrance of the port bunker, and
led the way along the machinery of the engine to a
small door which opened into the after-hold. On each
side of the engine was a store-room; and Pierre took
a key from his pocket, and opened one of them. Gregory
saw that it was the wine-room of the steamer.
Upon skids on the floor were several casks; and above
them were bins filled with bottles containing “vin
ordinaire,” or common claret. On the other side were
more bins, filled with other kinds of wine.</p>

<p>“Plenty of wine,” said Pierre, as he pointed with
entire satisfaction to the display of bottles. “This is
the best;” and he took one from the bin he pointed at.</p>

<p>Gregory read the label on the bottle, and understood
the matter well enough to realize that it was a kind of
Burgundy, much stronger than claret. He took a
couple of the bottles from the bin, and put them in the
pockets of his pea-jacket.</p>

<p>“Give me that key, Pierre,” said Gregory.</p>

<p>“No! no! no!” protested the Frenchman, with the
greatest earnestness.</p>

<p>Certainly Pierre had given his confidence to the
officer without any reserve; but he had done so only
after he had partaken of the wine offered him.
Whether Pierre had any Arabian notions about hospitality,
and believed that Gregory could not betray him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
after drinking out of the same bottle; or whether he
thought that the officer could not misuse his secret
after he had shared in the guilt by partaking of the
stolen fruit, or the juice of it,—or not,—cannot be
imagined; but he seemed to be as free with his officer
as though he had been one of his companions in the
fire-room.</p>

<p>But Pierre had an opinion of his own in regard to
the key; and he positively refused to give it up. Gregory
began to feel the effects of the strong Burgundy in
his head, for he could not carry off a whole tumbler of
it without being fearfully shaken in his upper works.
He felt the need of fresh air; for the hold was hot
from the furnaces. He tottered back by the way he
had come, followed by Pierre, who was evidently
assured that he had made a friend of the first officer
of the steamer, and that was almost as good as securing
an alliance with the captain. The Frenchman assisted
the officer of the deck out of the hold, for his steps
were becoming more and more unsteady as the fumes
of the wine rose in his head.</p>

<p>“What is the row down in the fire-room?” asked
Alexander, as the tipsy officer appeared in the engine-room.</p>

<p>“Nothing particular,” replied Gregory, trying to
stiffen the tones of his voice, which he could not help
realizing were very shaky. “The Frenchmen feel
good, and that makes them sing and talk loud; but
they are so far from the cabin that they can’t be heard,
and won’t disturb any one. Do you know whether
there is any wine on board?” asked Gregory.</p>

<p>“I don’t think there is; but I wish there were some,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
for I think a little of it would wake me up,” replied
Alexander.</p>

<p>“Wait a minute, then,” added the first officer as he
stepped out of the engine-room, and went to the mess-room,
where a lunch was kept on the table for the benefit
of the officers and seamen of the watch. Drawing
the cork of one of the bottles, and taking a tumbler
from the table, he hastened back to the engine-room as
fast as his shaky legs would permit, and poured out a
glass of the rich Burgundy, and offered it to the chief
engineer.</p>

<p>“What’s this?” asked Alexander, taking the glass.</p>

<p>“You said you wished there was some wine on board,
and that a little of it would wake you up,” added Gregory.
“Here it is;” and he spilled a part of it on the
floor as the steamer gave a smart roll.</p>

<p>Alexander took the glass, though he had some serious
doubts about drinking it. He had very rarely drank
wine; he very rarely had a chance to drink it; but if it
would wake the firemen, as the noise indicated that it
did,—for he was not so stupid as not to understand
what produced the unusual hilarity when Gregory came
out of the fire-room, and offered him a glass of wine,—it
would have the same effect on him. Still he hesitated
till one of his longest gapes had nearly choked him;
and then he drank off the contents of the glass.</p>

<p>“Now we are in for it together!” exclaimed Gregory,
when the engineer had tipped off the red draught.</p>

<p>“What do you mean by that?” demanded Alexander,
who did not exactly like the words, or the chuckle
that accompanied them.</p>

<p>“Give us your hand, Mr. Alexander! we are friends<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
now, if you do belong to the Tritonia,” said the malecontent,
with a laugh, for the liquor was beginning to
make him a little excitable.</p>

<p>The engineer could not well refuse his hand, and he
gave it to the jolly officer of the deck. Gregory left
the engine-room, and went to the mess-room. It was
lighted, and he found a hiding-place for the two bottles
of wine. He walked about the deck in the fresh air of
the night; and he felt happy and contented for the
time, and not at all inclined to foment a mutiny. When
four bells were struck, and Clinch reported to him to
relieve the deck, he let him into the secret, and gave
him a tumbler of the Burgundy. He took another at
the same time, and turned in without waiting to observe
the effect upon the third officer.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVII.<br>

<small>STRIKING WHILE THE IRON IS HOT.</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">BURGUNDY is bad stuff for anybody, and especially
bad for boys. Clinch found it necessary
to keep at a respectful distance from the seamen of his
quarter-watch, for he was conscious of being quite unsteady
on his feet; of being shaky to a degree that
could not be accounted for by the motion of the
steamer. But he knew what he was about all the time;
and, when he attended to the heaving of the log, he
kept up a constant shouting to the hands at the line, to
stimulate their interest in their work, and thus prevent
them from observing him. But the very thickness of
his tones as he spoke was enough to betray him, if
there had been any one present who was accustomed to
this phase of intoxication.</p>

<p>Alexander had found it more difficult to keep awake
after he had loaded himself with Burgundy than it was
before. If he kept his seat, he was sure to fall asleep;
and several times he “lost himself.” He knew that
the captain had a habit of prowling about the deck at
all hours of the night, as well as of the day; and for
this reason he felt obliged to keep on his feet during
the remainder of his watch, for it would have ruined<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
him to have the commander find him asleep at his
post. He did not consider the Burgundy experiment a
success.</p>

<p>Gregory slept like a log in his state-room till eight
o’clock, when all hands were called. He got out of his
berth with an aching head, and was as cross as a
spoiled child. He went to breakfast; but the strong
wine had destroyed his appetite so that he could not
taste food, and he only drank a cup of coffee. When
the meal was finished, Capt. Fairfield, who had prepared
the forward part of the cabin for a schoolroom,
summoned the starboard watch to attend to their recitations.
The lessons had been assigned the day before;
and the port-watch, composed of the officers and
seamen from the Tritonia, had faithfully studied them.
Richards had done so while on duty in the engine-room,
for he had not work enough to keep him employed
half of the time. He was so accustomed to
watching the gauge and the motion of the machinery,
that he could do it mechanically, as one writes with a
pen without thinking that he is writing. The chief
engineer had also studied his lessons when he ought to
have been asleep.</p>

<p>Gregory heard the summons to the recitation. He
had not studied his lessons, and the call was an unpleasant
one to him. The after-effect of the heavy
drams of Burgundy he had taken was not only to
make him cross, like a wilful child, but as ugly as a
hungry wild beast. He looked at the Josephines of the
starboard watch, as they passed into the cabin; and
they appeared to him like lambs going to the slaughter.
Not that they all, or even many of them, objected to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
the recitations; but he judged them by himself, and
interpreted their feelings by his own. He was utterly
opposed to the quarter-watch arrangement, which
seemed to be connected with the study scheme, inasmuch
as it afforded every student his needed recreation
without interfering with his lessons in ordinary weather.
He wanted the four hours’ leisure when his watch was
off duty.</p>

<p>Before the students had all seated themselves at the
tables arranged for study purposes, Clinch came to the
main door of the cabin, at which Gregory was standing.
They had been cronies since they came into the Josephine,
and each understood the other perfectly. Like
many others, they had both been sent to the academy
squadron after being expelled from other literary institutions.
They would have passed for bad boys before;
but the novel discipline of the nautical school had at
least produced a temporary reform. They had not
been made over in their minds and hearts, as many
had; but they had been transformed into obedient
sailors and diligent scholars. This was not enough;
but it was better than nothing. Gregory was fourth
lieutenant, and Clinch third master, of the Josephine;
and no doubt they had fairly won these positions by
their attention and zeal.</p>

<p>“Bob Clinch,” called Gregory, as the third officer
was passing into the cabin.</p>

<p>“What do you want, Dave?” demanded Clinch.</p>

<p>“I want to see you.”</p>

<p>“What for?”</p>

<p>“Come out here, and I will tell you.”</p>

<p>Gregory led the way to the port side of the deck,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
and hauled his friend into a corner where he could
speak to him without interruption. But suddenly he
seemed to change his mind, and conducted him to
the mess-room, which was not occupied at this time.
Taking from its hiding-place in the bottom of a locker
one of the bottles of Burgundy, he filled a couple of
glasses from it; and the cronies tossed them off quite
as a matter of course, as though it were a part of the
regular routine of the vessel. Neither of them spoke a
word, for each understood the other without any
speeches.</p>

<p>“I object to the present order of things on board,”
said Gregory, when he had restored the bottle to its
hiding-place, and rinsed the glasses so that no telltale
odor should betray him. “I am not going in to the
recitations.”</p>

<p>“Then there will be a row,” added Clinch lightly, as
though it were of no particular consequence if there
should be a tempest on board.</p>

<p>“I don’t care if there is: in fact, I should rather
like a little excitement,” added Gregory. “I don’t
feel at home on board of this craft. I have been
snubbed half a dozen times by O’Hara since I came
into the steamer.”</p>

<p>“Well, what are you going to do about it?”</p>

<p>“I am not going into the cabin to the recitations, in
the first place.”</p>

<p>“But you will have to fight that out with Capt. Fairfield,
and not with O’Hara,” suggested Clinch. “He
is the schoolmaster of the ship.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care whom I fight it out with. I feel that I
have been a good boy about as long as it will pay. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
looks to me just as though we had come to the end of
our service in the Josephine.”</p>

<p>“But we shall return to her.”</p>

<p>“I have my doubts about that. When we get to
England, if we go there, this vessel will be seized, attached,
taken possession of, or something or other of
that sort, and we shall all be afloat at loose ends; and
how shall we get back to the squadron among the Isles
of the Sea? The Prince is not going to wait for us,
and we have lost the Madeiras, which I wanted to see
more than all the rest of the islands.”</p>

<p>“I heard our vice-principal say that passengers are
entitled to salvage if they save a vessel after she has
been abandoned, or if they help take her into port
after she has been partially disabled; and I suppose
Mr. Frisbone will attend to the business, so far as the
steamer is concerned.”</p>

<p>“No matter for that: if we get to England, we shall
have no vessel to chase the squadron in; and I don’t
believe we shall ever find it. I think the cruise of the
fleet is ended, as I said.”</p>

<p>“What is the use of beating about the bush all day,
Dave? if you have any thing to say, why don’t you say
it. What do you mean to do?” demanded Clinch, a
little impatiently.</p>

<p>“Are you going in to the recitations, Bob?” asked
Gregory, as though this would settle the whole matter.</p>

<p>“No, not if you don’t: I shall follow your lead.”</p>

<p>“That’s all I want to know,” replied Gregory, opening
the door of the mess-room, and passing out on the
main deck.</p>

<p>“But that isn’t all I want to know,” added Clinch,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
following him. “If there is going to be a row, I want
to know my way into it, and my way out of it.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know that there will be any row,” answered
Gregory.</p>

<p>“If you refuse to attend recitations there will be,
without any doubt.”</p>

<p>“Capt. Fairfield wishes to see Mr. Gregory and Mr.
Clinch in the cabin,” said one of the quartermasters
of the starboard watch, touching his cap to the conspirators
at this moment.</p>

<p>“Tell Mr. Fairfield, that, with entire respect for him,
we have decided not to attend recitations to-day,” replied
Gregory promptly.</p>

<p>Stokes was the quartermaster who had delivered the
message; and he started back with astonishment at
the reply of the first officer.</p>

<p>“Shall I say that to him?” he asked, thinking that
perhaps Gregory was joking.</p>

<p>“Say that to him,” added Gregory decidedly.</p>

<p>By this time the fumes of the wine were well up into
his head, and he had a courage not his own; and Clinch
was affected in the same way.</p>

<p>“Very well, Mr. Gregory,” replied Stokes; but he
did not seem inclined to deliver the message.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you go back to the cabin with the answer
I gave you?” demanded the first officer; but his
manner was strange to the quartermaster,—rather silly
and simpering.</p>

<p>“If the officers of the ship do not attend recitations,
I don’t know why the seamen should,” added Stokes,
encouraged to make the remark by the light tone of
his superior.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>“They can do as they please,” answered Gregory,
with a snuff and a chuckle. “But go and deliver the
message to the instructor.”</p>

<p>“I should like to ask if the rest of the starboard
watch may decide not to attend recitations,” continued
Stokes, who was very anxious to learn something more
in regard to the position of the officers before him.</p>

<p>“Come into the mess-room, Stokes,” said Gregory,
leading the way. “The rest of the watch can do just
as they please.”</p>

<p>The young tippler—he was nineteen—took the
bottle from the locker, and, knowing the quartermaster
very well, he gave him a glass of the wine. Possibly
he thought the dose would stimulate his ideas, and enable
him to reach the conclusion to which his superiors
had arrived. Stokes was willing enough to imbibe, and
he drank off the contents of the glass.</p>

<p>“I should like to know what’s up,” said the messenger
from the cabin.</p>

<p>“In a word, then, we don’t like the way things are
managed on board. The captain has disregarded his
instructions; and that absolves us all from obeying his
orders,” replied Gregory, as he drank another dram.</p>

<p>“Is that the idea?” asked Stokes.</p>

<p>“That’s just it. The captain has divided us into
quarter-watches, and it is by his royal mandate that we
are to study our lessons and recite them.”</p>

<p>“The captain’s? If that is so, how does Capt. Fairfield
happen to be on board?” inquired Stokes, who
could not help seeing the flaw in the first officers
argument.</p>

<p>“I suppose he was sent on board to look after us a
little.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>“But all hands were required to take their books and
exercise-papers with them.”</p>

<p>“That was so that any might study who were inclined.
I am not inclined.”</p>

<p>“No more am I,” added Stokes, laughing, as the
Burgundy began to operate in his upper story.</p>

<p>“As a matter of duty, I don’t know as we ought to
let this thing go any farther; for, as the case stands
now, O’Hara is actually running away with the vessel,”
continued Gregory, whose speech was beginning to be
a little thick. “When a lot of fellows ran away with
the Tritonia, and were going on an independent cruise
in her, the ones that took possession of her and brought
her back were treated like lords by the faculty, and
praised up to the skies for what they had done.”</p>

<p>“Come in, Lawring!” called Clinch, as he saw the
other quartermaster of the starboard watch at the door
of the mess-room.</p>

<p>“Capt. Fairfield sent me to see what had become of
Stokes,” said Lawring, as he came into the mess-room.</p>

<p>“Well, you see, don’t you?” leered Gregory, whose
head was buzzing as though it contained a circular saw
in motion. “Here, Lawring, you are a good fellow.”</p>

<p>The first officer took the second bottle of Burgundy
from the locker (for the first was empty by this time),
and filled the glass on the table. Clinch looked out
of the window on the deck to warn his companion of the
approach of any one who might interfere with their
pastime. But no one disturbed them.</p>

<p>“Drink this, Lawring,” said Gregory, when he had
filled the glass.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>“What is it?” inquired the quartermaster, as he
looked from one to another in the apartment, wondering
what could be going on.</p>

<p>“It’s the best wine on board of the Ville d’Angers,
and as good as you can find anywhere,” replied Gregory
in maudlin tones. “Take it, Lawring: it will do
you good.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Mr. Gregory: I never drink wine,” answered
the quartermaster, as he looked over the three
former occupants of the mess-room; and he was fully
satisfied that all of them had been partaking of the
wine.</p>

<p>If the first officer of the steamer was not tipsy, he
had never seen a person in that condition.</p>

<p>“If you never drank any wine, it is time for you to
begin,” chuckled Gregory.</p>

<p>“Thank you, Mr. Gregory: I don’t wish for any,”
returned Lawring decidedly.</p>

<p>“I tell you to drink it; and I am the first officer of
this craft.”</p>

<p>“Excuse me: I signed the pledge before I left home;
and I intend never to drink any thing as long as I live.”</p>

<p>“But I am your superior officer!” persisted Gregory,
in broken speech. “You must obey me!”</p>

<p>The tippler began to be angry, and stormed at the
quartermaster in his incoherent speech.</p>

<p>“I will not drink wine in obedience to any body’s
orders,” replied Lawring firmly.</p>

<p>“You won’t! then I’ll make you drink it!”</p>

<p>“Dry up, Dave!” interposed Clinch.</p>

<p>“What reply shall I take to Capt. Fairfield, Stokes?”
asked Lawring, as he opened the door behind him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>“Tell Capt. Fairfield, that, with entire respect for him,
we have decided not to attend any recitations,” answered
Stokes, sending the reply which Gregory had
given him.</p>

<p>“Don’t let him go till I bust in his head!” exclaimed
the first officer, staggering towards the door to intercept
the departing quartermaster.</p>

<p>“No, no; don’t get up a fight here,” said Clinch,
taking his crony by the collar, and detaining him.</p>

<p>Lawring did not wait for any thing more; but hastened
back to the cabin, where the rest of the watch
were engaged in their recitations.</p>

<p>“Stokes says, that, with entire respect for you, Capt.
Fairfield, he has decided not to attend any recitations,”
said Lawring, reporting to the instructor.</p>

<p>“Indeed! and did you see Gregory and Clinch?”
inquired the astonished teacher.</p>

<p>“They were all in the mess-room forward, sir.”</p>

<p>“What does this mean? did they assign any reason
for their conduct?”</p>

<p>“No, sir; but I think that all three of them have
been drinking wine; and Mr. Gregory is intoxicated,”
added the quartermaster.</p>

<p>“Intoxicated!” exclaimed Capt. Fairfield. “I
think you must be mistaken, Lawring.”</p>

<p>“No, sir, I am not. They had a bottle of red wine,
and Mr. Gregory asked me to drink a glass of it.”</p>

<p>Capt. Fairfield was bewildered at this intelligence.
Three of the students who ought to be at their studies
were drinking wine in the mess-room. Certainly this
was all wrong. The students were not allowed to
drink wine, to say nothing of refusing to attend to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
lessons. But the instructor was a prudent man; and
he paused to consider his own powers in the premises.
He had been sent on board to instruct the ship’s company;
and he concluded that his authority was the
same as that of any other professor in the absence of
the principal or a vice-principal. He had the entire
control of the students during study hours, unless they
were ordered to do ship’s duty by the captain. He
could not interfere with the navigation of the vessel;
but he could compel the attendance of the pupils at
the proper hours in the cabin.</p>

<p>Leaving the cabin, he went on the poop-deck, where
O’Hara was, and stated the case to him. The young
captain was very much disconcerted by the intelligence
that some of the students were insubordinate, but
especially so that the first and third officers were in
a state of intoxication and rebellion. It was clear
enough that the tipplers had found a way to get into
the wine-room in the hold. Mr. Frisbone had taken
the key to this room; and it was a mystery how the
students had got into it.</p>

<p>O’Hara told Capt. Fairfield that he had full powers
to compel the attendance of the members of the starboard watch
in the cabin, and advised him to call upon
the boatswain and carpenter if he needed any assistance.
While the instructor went to attend to this
duty, O’Hara called for the stewards, and visited the
hold with them. They knew nothing about the wine
or the wine-room. The door was locked, and all appeared
to be right about it. But, while they were investigating
the matter, the captain saw Alfonzo come out
of the fire-room, and creep under the engine to the door<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
leading into the after-hold. He went below again, and
the fireman unlocked the door of the wine-room. When
he had gone in, the captain crept up to the door, and
took out the key. Calling the two stewards, they drove
Alfonzo out, and locked the door.</p>

<p>“Keep this key,” said O’Hara to the man who acted
as chief steward, “and search the ship all over. If
you find any wine or liquors, lock them up.”</p>

<p>It so happened that the firemen had exhausted the
supply they had in the fire-room, and had sent Alfonzo
for another stock. He had found the key in the fire-room.
The stewards found that which Gregory had
concealed in the locker, and it was secured. No wine
was to be had except in the wine-room. As a further
precaution, the captain ordered the carpenter to transfer
two heavy bars of iron from another door to this
one. As each bar was secured by a large lock, it was
not likely the room would be broken into.</p>

<p>Capt. Fairfield went to the mess-room after he left
the captain. The students there were respectful to
him at first; but, when he spoke of enforcing his authority,
Gregory was impudent; and the others, whose
heads were full of wine, followed his example.</p>

<p>But the instructor was a rigid disciplinarian; and,
calling in Shakings, they dragged the first and third
officers and the quartermaster into the cabin. But they
were all too much intoxicated to study or recite; and
Capt. Fairfield locked them into a couple of spare
state-rooms.</p>

<p>By noon they had all slept off the effects of the wine.
O’Hara had been thinking all the morning about the
case of discipline on hand, and confidently expected<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
trouble as soon as the time came to change the watch.
He had made up his mind what to do; but his action
must be governed by the circumstances. Only three of
the students from the Josephine had thus far been insubordinate;
but all the rest might join them. But he
apprehended no difficulty, for the officers and seamen
from the Tritonia were enough to handle the steamer.</p>

<p>Gregory had been let out of the state-room, completely
sobered, at half-past eleven, so that he could
dine with his watch in season to take the deck at noon.
He was even more cross and ugly than he had been in
the morning.</p>

<p>“All the starboard watch on deck!” shouted the
acting boatswain, piping the call.</p>

<p>Gregory did not move from the seat he had taken at
the cabin-door. O’Hara trembled as he saw that the
first officer was intent upon making trouble.</p>

<p>“The deck is yours, Mr. Gregory,” said Raymond,
tendering to him the trumpet, in the usual form.</p>

<p>“I don’t want it,” growled the first officer. “I shall
not do duty any more.”</p>

<p>Raymond reported the answer to the captain.</p>

<p>“Call all hands!” said O’Hara promptly.</p>

<p>The call was immediately piped. As on board the
vessels of the squadron, every officer and seaman had
his station, and was required to repair to it instantly,
whether the call came by day or night.</p>

<p>Every one went to his station except the three who
had refused to attend the recitations. Possibly the
conspirators could have induced others of their shipmates
in the Josephine to join them; but they had had
no time to work the case up.</p>

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>“Here, Winchell!” shouted Gregory to one of his
own watch. “Don’t go! We are going to stand out.
O’Hara is running away with the steamer, and we need
not obey orders.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Shakings, you will take charge of the first
officer,” said the young captain. “Lock him into his
state-room, and keep him there.”</p>

<p>Clinch followed the lead of his crony, and Mr. Rimmer
was directed to serve him in the same way. Both
of them were disposed to show fight; but the stout
boatswain and carpenter made quick work with them.
Stokes concluded, at this particular moment, not to
“stand out,” and went to his station at the wheel.</p>

<p>No doubt Gregory was astonished to find himself
and his conspiracy so easily overcome. He was a
prisoner by himself, and likely to remain so for a considerable
time.</p>

<p>As soon as the mutineers were disposed of, O’Hara
called the ship’s company together. He did not allude
to the event which had just transpired, except to state the
fact that there were two vacancies in the officers’ cabin;
and it was necessary that they should be immediately
filled, for two quarter-watches were without officers.
After consulting with Speers and Raymond, both of
whom insisted that the vacant places should be filled
without promoting either of them, the captain appointed
Lawring first officer in place of Gregory, and Taylor in
place of Clinch; both of them from the Josephine.</p>

<p>The firemen made a new demand for wine; but they
obtained none, and they did not deem it prudent to
“strike” again. In five days more the Ville d’Angers
arrived at Portsmouth, with the Castle William in tow.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVIII.<br>

<small>A TRIP TO THE CANARY ISLANDS.</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">“ARRIVED at Portsmouth, steamer Ville d’Angers,
having in tow the hulk of the ship Castle
William, dismasted in the violent gale of April 8,”
read Mr. Pelham, from a newspaper which had just
been received by the African steamer.</p>

<p>He had hastened on board of the Prince with the
paper as soon as he obtained it. The news was certainly
very important, for it assured the principal that
the missing steamer was safe; and, in the absence of
any additional intelligence, it was presumed that her
crew were all well.</p>

<p>Mr. Fluxion took the paper, and looked it over.
He was especially happy because his confident prediction
that the Ville d’Angers was all right, had been
fully verified. Mr. Lowington was delighted in the
safety of the students on board of her. The Marian
was still in port; for Judge Rodwood enjoyed the
climate of the island and the frequent hospitality of
Don Roderigue so much, that he was in no haste to
pursue his truant ward.</p>

<p>A boat was immediately sent to the Marian to inform
the judge that his ward had been heard from, and was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
believed to be all right. He was glad to hear it, though
he seemed to be in no hurry to leave the beautiful
islands.</p>

<p>“Ah, here is more news!” exclaimed Mr. Fluxion,
who was still looking over the paper.</p>

<p>“About the steamer?” asked Mr. Lowington.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir: here is a tolerably full account of the
voyage of the Ville d’Angers, and of the state of things
on board of the Castle William,” continued the senior
vice-principal, as he seated himself under the awning
on the quarter-deck of the American Prince.</p>

<p>“Let us hear it,” added the principal eagerly.</p>

<p>It was a Southampton paper; and the editor reminded
his readers of the visit of the academy squadron to the
waters of the Solent and Spithead, and the race around
the Isle of Wight, about six years before. Then followed
an account of the picking-up of the French
steamer, and the subsequent falling-in with the wreck
of the Castle William.</p>

<p>“A very wealthy American gentleman,” the article
continued, “who was the patron of the academy
squadron, and had presented to its distinguished principal
an elegant and costly steam-yacht of twelve hundred
tons burden, happened to be a passenger, with
his family, in the Ville d’Angers from Havre to Malaga.
When the condition of things on board of the unfortunate
Castle William was ascertained, this noble-hearted
gentleman, with his wife and her sister, went on board
of the hulk where pestilence and death were raging,
and tenderly nursed the sick. Mr. Frisbone, who is
jocosely called the ‘American Prince,’—and he is one
of Nature’s most royal princes,—immediately resorted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
to various sanitary measures, and with his own hands
whitewashed the space between decks of the fever-stricken
vessel. The medicines and supplies put on
board of the ship by the steamer were so well used
that the sick immediately began to improve; and now
all are doing well. They have all been removed to
the quarantine hospital, where the small-pox patients
are convalescent.</p>

<p>“Undoubtedly the careful nursing of the sick by
this self-sacrificing gentleman and the ladies saved
the lives of many, if not all, of the sick. Certainly
the heroic exertions of the young gentlemen of the
school-ship saved the vessel and her freight of human
beings; and they deserve the highest praise. Mr.
Frisbone, as the agent of the principal of the academy
squadron, has libelled the Castle William for salvage;
and we learn that negotiations for an amicable adjustment
of the amount are in progress. The owners of
the steamer, by their attorney, have already put in their
claim for the Ville d’Angers, subject to reasonable salvage.</p>

<p>“We regret to add that there has been some trouble
about the discipline among the young officers of the
steamer. The first and third officers of the steamer,
appointed by the senior vice-principal in charge of
one of the vessels of the academy squadron, were
mutinous, and refused to do duty, attempting to incite
others of the crew to follow their example. Possibly
it was a boyish frolic; but the young captain promptly
caused the arrest of the two offenders, and has kept
them prisoners in their state-rooms up to the present
time. But all the rest of the ship’s company yield a
willing obedience to the authority of the captain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>“We regard Capt. O’Hara, for such is his name,
as a rather remarkable young gentleman. Mr. Frisbone
assures our informant that he is a thorough seaman,
having served before the mast, and worked his
way up to fourth lieutenant of the vessel to which he is
attached. He was born in Italy, of an Irish father
formerly in the English consular service, and an Italian
mother. He is twenty years of age, and speaks Italian
and French as fluently as he does English. Though
there is an instructor, as well as two adult forward officers,
attached to the ship, she is under the entire management
of her youthful commander.”</p>

<p>This was the principal portion of the article which
Mr. Fluxion read, to which the party gave the most
undivided attention. Of course it was gratifying to the
professional pride of the principal; and both of the
vice-principals congratulated themselves upon their
own discretion in appointing O’Hara to the command
of the steamer, though it was not foreseen that he
would make such an extended cruise in her.</p>

<p>“I am sorry to learn that there has been trouble on
board of the steamer,” said Mr. Lowington, when the
account of the voyage had been partly digested.</p>

<p>“But O’Hara seems to have made an end of the
mutiny at once,” replied Mr. Fluxion.</p>

<p>“He is a very decided fellow,” added Mr. Pelham.
“He is a peaceable and well-disposed young man; but
he would fight his way through any thing if the occasion
required.”</p>

<p>“This paper says the first and third officers were
insubordinate,” continued the principal anxiously.
“Who were these officers?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>“Gregory was the first, and Clinch was the third
officer,” replied Mr. Fluxion, not a little disconcerted,
as the heavy frown on his brow indicated. “I am sorry
to say that both of them were from the Josephine.”</p>

<p>“They used to be bad boys,” said Mr. Lowington.</p>

<p>“For the last year there have been no better officers
or students in the vessel than Gregory and Clinch. I
don’t understand it,” replied Mr. Fluxion, musing.
“Possibly O’Hara has been a little airy, and provoked
them: it would not be strange if any young fellow
should feel good, in command of a steamer of six hundred
tons.”</p>

<p>“It is not at all like O’Hara to put on airs,” interposed
Mr. Pelham.</p>

<p>“Even if he did, that is no excuse for Gregory,”
added Mr. Fluxion.</p>

<p>“I suppose we shall not understand the matter till
we see the students, and get their account of the
affair,” said Mr. Lowington.</p>

<p>“The name of my ward is not mentioned in connection
with this business,” remarked the judge.</p>

<p>“He is not mentioned as a mutineer; and so far it
is perfectly satisfactory,” added Dr. Phelps.</p>

<p>“I have no doubt he has done his duty faithfully,”
said Mr. Pelham.</p>

<p>“But when shall we have these young fellows back
here?” asked Judge Rodwood.</p>

<p>“That is more than I can tell: they are out of my
reach, and I cannot instruct them what to do,” replied
the principal. “But Mr. Frisbone is happily with
them; and I have entire confidence in his good judgment
and discretion.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>“What will he do with them? He has no authority
over them; and I fancy, if they once get ashore, Capt.
O’Hara will not be as powerful as he seems to have
been on board. What will they do?”</p>

<p>“I have no doubt Mr. Frisbone will send them to
these islands in the next steamer, and come himself,
if he is not wholly disgusted with his experience at
sea.”</p>

<p>“The steamer which arrived to-day is an extra one,”
said Mr. Pelham. “The next steamer will not leave
Southampton till the 24th of the month, and will arrive
on the 30th.”</p>

<p>“And this is only the 21st,” added the judge.
“Shall we remain here nine or ten days longer?”</p>

<p>“We will consider that matter,” replied Mr. Lowington,
rising from his deck-chair.</p>

<p>The conference was ended, and all returned to their
own vessels. The principal went forward to the chart-room,
on the table of which was spread out the chart
of the North Atlantic. He looked it over, applied the
parallel ruler and the dividers. In less than half an
hour orders were sent to the Josephine and the Tritonia
to sail at four o’clock in the afternoon for Santa
Cruz, Teneriffe, one of the Canary Islands. Notice
of this intention was sent to Judge Rodwood, who
immediately hastened on board of the Prince to ascertain
more definitely the intentions of the principal.</p>

<p>“You seem to have come to a sudden conclusion,”
said the judge, when he met the principal on the deck
of the Prince.</p>

<p>“My absent students cannot get to Funchal under
ten days; and I cannot afford to lose so much time,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
replied Mr. Lowington. “It is only a day’s run for
the steamer to the Canaries; and we can spend a week
at Santa Cruz, or in cruising about the islands, and
return in season to take them on board.”</p>

<p>“Excellent!” exclaimed the judge. “I shall go
with you; and this excursion will afford me an opportunity
to reciprocate the hospitality of our friend Don
Roderigue; for I shall invite him and his family to
take passage in the Marian.”</p>

<p>“I was just thinking of offering them state-rooms
on board of the American Prince; but I have no
doubt you can accommodate them more elegantly than
I can; and I will yield the privilege to you, judge.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Mr. Principal.”</p>

<p>Judge Rodwood hastened on shore to extend the
invitation to Don Roderigue; and great was the
delight of the young officers when they saw Dona
Maria go on board of the Marian just before the hour
appointed for the sailing of the squadron. They
lustily cheered the party. Don Roderigue raised his
hat, and bowed his thanks, while his daughter vigorously
waved her handkerchief.</p>

<p>Promptly at the hour set, the two steamers and the
two schooners got under way, and stood out of the
Bay of Funchal. The wind was quite fresh from the
west, veering a little to the north, so that the sailing-vessels
had all the breeze they wanted. It had been
agreed that the vessels of the fleet should keep together,
and the steamers were worked at about two-thirds
of their ordinary speed to accommodate them.
The course was true south till seven o’clock in the
morning, when the Salvages, a group of islands with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
very rocky and dangerous surroundings, bore to the
eastward; and then the fleet was headed to the east
south-east. The islands looked barren and forbidding.</p>

<p>“Land, sharp on the weather-bow!” shouted the
lookout on the top-gallant forecastle of the Tritonia.</p>

<p>“Land!” exclaimed Scott, who had the deck.
“There is no land within a hundred miles in that
direction. The lookout has a gravel-stone in his eye,
and thinks it is an island.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be too sure of that, Scott,” added the vice-principal,
leaping on the rail at the weather side, and
looking out in the direction indicated by the lookout.
“I see it.”</p>

<p>The lieutenant sprang into the weather rigging, and
strained his eyes to the utmost; but he could see nothing
that looked like land.</p>

<p>“I think I am getting blind, sir,” added Scott, with
a laugh.</p>

<p>“Where are you looking? Up here!” and Mr.
Pelham pointed a considerable distance above the
horizon.</p>

<p>“Up there! I shouldn’t think of looking up there
for land, unless I expected to find it in the moon,”
replied Scott. “The Mountains of the Moon are away
over on the other side of Africa. Are you looking for
them?”</p>

<p>“Don’t you see that mountain?” continued Mr.
Pelham, pointing again.</p>

<p>“I see it now,” answered Scott, as he made out a
mazy mass, high above the horizon. “What in the
world is that?”</p>

<p>“It is the peak of Teneriffe.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>“I have heard enough about it to know it without
an introduction.”</p>

<p>“It must be nearly a hundred miles off.”</p>

<p>“And we are in no immediate danger of getting
aground on that land.”</p>

<p>This mountain was the point of attraction for the
day, as it gradually displayed its outline more clearly
to the students. At three o’clock in the afternoon, the
squadron rounded Point Anaga, the north-eastern cape
of Teneriffe. It was only nine miles farther to the
chief town of the island; and by five, the squadron
was at anchor, and all the formalities of the government
had been complied with.</p>

<p>At eight the next morning all hands were assembled
in the grand saloon of the Prince, to hear what Mr.
Mapps had to say about the Canary Islands in general,
and Teneriffe in particular.</p>

<p>“The <i>Islas Canarias</i>, as the Spaniards have it, or
the Canaries, or Canary Islands, as we have it, lie
between thirteen and eighteen degrees of west longitude,
and between twenty-seven and a half and twenty-nine
and a half degrees of north latitude. They have
an aggregate area of thirty-two hundred square miles,
and a population of two hundred and twenty-seven
thousand. There are seven principal islands, the most
important of which are Teneriffe, Grand Canary, and
Palma. These islands are all very mountainous, volcanic,
and rocky. The peak of Teneriffe, which we
have had in sight since yesterday morning, is over
twelve thousand feet high.</p>

<p>“The two most western islands are Hierro, or Ferro,
and Palma, both of which contain peaks from five to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
over seven thousand feet high. The meridian which
passes through Ferro was the one formerly selected as
the first, from which longitude was measured; and for
this reason it has been adopted as the dividing line between
the Eastern and Western Hemispheres. Gomera
is fourteen miles south-west of Teneriffe. The water
between these islands is very deep; and there are no
dangers, except within a few hundred feet of the shore.</p>

<p>“Teneriffe is forty-five miles long, and twenty-two
wide. The natives call the summit of the mountain
which stands in the middle of the island, the ‘Pico de
Teyde.’ We saw it yesterday morning when we were
nearly a hundred miles from it; and the people say it
can be seen a hundred and sixty miles, but this is
vanity on their part. There are generally more or less
clouds hanging about it. Santa Cruz, or ‘Holy Cross,’
is the most driving city of all the islands of the Atlantic.
It has twenty thousand inhabitants. The mole which
you see is of recent construction, and was very much
needed to protect the shipping from the strong winds
coming from north-east to south-east. There is some
British naval history connected with this city. In 1657
Admiral Blake destroyed a Spanish fleet, anchored under
the batteries of the town; and, favored by a sudden
change of wind, got his ships out of the harbor with
but little loss. Nelson lost an arm here in 1797, and
was badly beaten in his battle with Fort San Miguel,
which is still in existence. British flags are so scarce
with the Spaniards, that those captured in this engagement
are still on exhibition in the principal church of
the city. In the middle of the summer the heat in the
town is very oppressive; and the wealthy inhabitants<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
flee from it to Laguna, a place among the hills, five
miles inland.</p>

<p>“On the north-west side of Teneriffe is the port and
city of Orotava, which is probably the best health station
in the world for invalids troubled with throat and
lung diseases. It is located in an amphitheatre of hills,
two or three miles from the sea. It is even superior to
Madeira in the uniformity of its temperature. The
region around it is a perfect garden, and the thermometer
never falls below fifty degrees, or rises more than a
degree or two above eighty; and these extremes are of
very rare occurrence. The average temperature is
about sixty-eight degrees. One month hardly varies
more than a couple of degrees from the one next to it.
Invalids here may remain out of doors all the time,
and keep their windows open night and day. But it
has not yet become to any great extent a health resort;
and there is a lack of accommodations for visitors and
temporary residents.</p>

<p>“The Grand Canary is about fifty miles to the south-east
of Teneriffe. It is a beautiful island, fertile and
populous; and until recently the seat of government,
which has been transferred to Teneriffe. It has a range
of mountains, some peaks of which are over six thousand
feet high. Many streams flow from these hills,
which in the rainy season become raging torrents.
Las Palmas, or the Palms, is a city of twenty thousand
inhabitants, formerly the capital of the islands; but
Santa Cruz de Teneriffe, as it is called to distinguish
it from another Santa Cruz in the island of Palma, has
wrested from it this distinction; and there is a strong
rivalry between the two places. It is still the Church<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
capital of the Canaries. It is overlooked by two
high mountains; and through the city runs the
Guiniguada River, which is crossed by a bridge with
immense arches, built two hundred years ago. It has
some fine buildings, and several educational institutions.
The harbor is very bad, for a heavy surf rolls in most
of the time; but it has a sheltered port two miles to
the eastward of it.</p>

<p>“Fuerteventura lies east of Teneriffe, and is fifty-two miles
long. It has the appearance of being a barren
island, but has very fertile spots in it. The mountains
are not so high as in Grand Canary, and it has no good
harbors. Lanzarote lies to the north-east, and is thirty-one
miles long. Alegranza is a small island, and the
most northerly of the group; but it is celebrated as
being the home from which first came the beautiful
songster we call the canary-bird. There are other
small islands. Fuerteventura is only about sixty miles
from the coast of Africa.</p>

<p>“These islands form a province of Spain, and are
represented in the Cortes of the mother country. Mail-vessels
ply between the different islands, and there is
frequent communication by steamer with Spain and
England. The people are Spaniards, a little darker of
complexion than those you meet in Spain. The islands
are generally very fertile, and the productions of both
the torrid and the temperate zone are raised here. The
vine has been an important item, and forty thousand
pipes of wine were the average manufacture until 1853,
when the grape disease destroyed the vines; but, like
Madeira, these islands are rapidly recovering from this
disaster.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>“The Canaries are believed to have been known to
the ancients, and to have been mentioned by Pliny
the Elder, and others, as the Fortunate Islands. The
ruins of some stone temples in Gomera indicate that
they were known to the Carthaginians. Like the
Madeiras, they were discovered in modern days by a
vessel driven off its course by heavy weather, in 1334.
They were conquered—and the original inhabitants
fought well for their country—by Jean de Bethencourt,
a Norman baron in the service of Spain, in 1402. They
were claimed by the Portuguese, and the natives were
troublesome for a long period; but Spain eventually
obtained full possession.”</p>

<p>The professor finished his remarks, after he had spoken
for some time about the manners and customs of
the aborigines of the islands, as indicated by the implements
and ruins found in them; and then the students
of the Tritonia and Josephine returned to their
vessels.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIX.<br>

<small>WALKS AND TALKS ABOUT THE CANARY ISLANDS.</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">AS soon as the lecture of Mr. Mapps was ended, all
hands were allowed to go on shore. The elegant
barge of the Marian had gone directly from the American
Prince to the landing-place, having on board Don
Roderigue and his daughter. The boat was pulled by
four seamen with a coxswain in the stern, all attired in
holiday uniforms; and the barge was fitted up as gayly
as a festive gondola in the Grand Canal of Venice, for
the young lady and her father.</p>

<p>“Here we are!” exclaimed Lieut. Scott, as he
stepped on the shore with Capt. Wainwright. “I had
an idea we should hear immense flocks of canary-birds
whistling in the island, and be in canary-seed up to our
knees.”</p>

<p>“Of course you did not expect to see canary-birds in
the streets of a city, unless you saw them in cages,”
added the captain. “Didn’t the professor just tell you
these birds came from the island of Alegranza?”</p>

<p>“I supposed he only said that to get off that jawbreaker.
I couldn’t tell the names of more than two
of these islands after he had given them all.”</p>

<p>“That was because you had not looked them up beforehand.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
Most of them are given on the chart of the
North Atlantic.”</p>

<p>“I am not so much of a bookworm as some of the
fellows.”</p>

<p>“Here comes Dr. Winstock,” continued Wainwright,
as the captain’s barge of the Prince came up to the
landing.</p>

<p>“I suppose he will convoy us here, as he has before,”
added Scott. “I wonder if there is a place on the face
of the earth where he has not been.”</p>

<p>“He was a surgeon in the navy for a good many
years; and I suppose our men-of-war have visited all
these islands.”</p>

<p>“Are you willing to take us in tow, doctor?” asked
Scott, as the surgeon, attended by Capt. Sheridan and
Lieut. Murray, approached them.</p>

<p>“I shall be very happy to do so if you won’t labor
too hard with those tremendous jokes of yours,” replied
the doctor, laughing.</p>

<p>“I don’t think I labor very hard at them. I try to
be as solemn as an owl; but somehow I don’t get
along worth a cent,” pleaded Scott.</p>

<p>“I should be sorry to have you break your back by
struggling in the other direction; and I have not the
slightest objection to your jokes; only labor not to be
funny.”</p>

<p>“I strive not to do so; and I have rejected some of
the best things ever thought of, because I found I had
been studying upon them.”</p>

<p>“Doubtless you did wisely. But we will commence
our walk,” added Dr. Winstock, as he led the way from
the shore. “I suppose you noticed the appearance of
the island from the ships?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>“I noticed it during the whole of my watch yesterday,”
replied Scott; “and I thought it looked more
like a busted volcano than any thing I ever saw before.”</p>

<p>“At a distance the mountain near the centre seems
to be the whole island; and some of the pictures of the
peak make it rise directly from the sea.”</p>

<p>“The whole thing looked like a cinder just raked out
of a blacksmith’s forge. It don’t look so now.”</p>

<p>“It reminds me of Greece, where the hills are red
and barren. There appears to be no room for the cultivation
of any thing on this island, as you look at it
from the sea; for we cannot see any thing of its beautiful
valleys and plains enclosed by mountains. But the
appearance is not very far from the fact, for not more
than one-seventh of the whole surface of the island can
be cultivated; but the arable land is immensely productive.”</p>

<p>“What do they raise here?” asked Murray.</p>

<p>“Grapes, which they manufacture into wine and
brandy; mulberry-trees, with which they feed the silk-worm,
and silk is one of the exports; potatoes, wheat,
Indian corn, oranges, almonds; and the bees produce
honey and wax for shipment. Cochineal is a very important
article of commerce.”</p>

<p>“What is cochineal?” asked Scott. “I heard some
one say it was made of bugs, and was used to color
candy and things.”</p>

<p>“Some one told you correctly. Cochineal is a very
valuable dye-stuff. It consists of the bodies of the <i>cocus
cacti</i>, a little bug about the size of a grain of barley,
but more in the shape of a dried pea. It belongs to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
the <i>cocidæ</i>, which are the most injurious of insects about
plants, as in hot-houses. The orange-trees of the Azores
were well-nigh destroyed by them in 1843; and Fayal,
which usually exports twelve thousand boxes of this
fruit, did not send off a single one that year.”</p>

<p>The party had paused on the street near the beach
to hear the account; and the doctor pointed out a package
of the cochineal, as an illustration of his subject.</p>

<p>“The <i>cocus cacti</i> is so called because it feeds on a
certain kind of cactus, which has to be cultivated as
the food of the insect. The production of cochineal
was carried on in Mexico, which is the country of the
cactus, long before it was known to Cortes or any other
European. Only the female insect is used in the manufacture
of the color. The male has wings, but the
female has none.”</p>

<p>“That’s so that they cannot go gadding about,”
added Scott.</p>

<p>“Very likely; for the female fastens herself to a
plant; and this branch is cut off with the creature
upon it. The laborer forms a sort of soft nest on the
cochineal plant; and, when the mother has been placed
on it, she lays her eggs. The young when hatched
spread themselves over the plant, feeding upon it, till
they are in condition for use. As the insect produces
several crops of eggs in a year, the young are soon
ready to lay eggs; but they must be killed before they
are in condition to do this, or it would injure the quality
of the cochineal. The branch on which the insects
are gathered is cut, and plunged into boiling water, in
order to kill them. They are then collected and dried;
and in this condition it takes seventy thousand of them
to make a pound of cochineal.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>“Then it is the corpses of these bugs that is used to
put the red streak into a stick of peppermint candy,”
added Scott.</p>

<p>“Such is the fact; and it may cure you of the tendency
to eat candy.”</p>

<p>“I think not, sir; for I can stand it if the corpses
can,” answered Scott.</p>

<p>“We will walk up into the town,” continued the doctor,
leading the way.</p>

<p>“The houses are very pretty,” said Sheridan, as he
noticed the extreme whiteness of all the buildings.</p>

<p>“They are built of stone, and whitewashed.”</p>

<p>“Just as they serve erring office-holders at home.”</p>

<p>“They can’t make them white as these houses
are.”</p>

<p>“Creation! there is a woman that looks like a squaw
of a band of travelling Indians!—stove-pipe hat and
all!” exclaimed Scott. “There is another with a load
on her head.”</p>

<p>“The women are the principal beasts of burden in
Teneriffe. They walk twenty miles in from the country,
with a load of market-stuff on their heads,” added the
doctor.</p>

<p>There was nothing very peculiar about the costume
of the woman, except the hat, and a sort of cloth thrown
over the head, and worn under the hat, which dropped
over the arms and shoulders, like a shawl. The lower
class of men wore short trousers, the front covered with
goat-skin, a short jacket, and gaiters over their shoes.
Many carried a staff as tall as the arm-pits. There
were a few beggars about the streets, as there are in all
Spanish towns; and their costume is as miscellaneous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
as those in Spain wear, except that the cloak is not
endurable in this warm climate.</p>

<p>“This is the <i>Plaza de la Constitution</i>,” said the doctor
as they entered a handsome square, bordered by a broad
street, and liberally provided with street-lamps.</p>

<p>“I knew it was before you said a word!” exclaimed
Scott.</p>

<p>“How did you know it?”</p>

<p>“Because the Spaniards all live on the constitution;
and they have a square in every town that is big enough
to hold one, with that name to it,” replied the joker,
laughing. “I think they will use the constitution up
one of these days, and have to fall back on the by-laws.”</p>

<p>“But this is a very pretty square; and the whole
town is as neat as any thing we have seen,” added
Sheridan. “These buildings are very fine; and I am
sure I had no idea of finding any such a town among
the Isles of the Sea.”</p>

<p>“The Spaniards here think a great deal of their city;
and they have been liberal in the matter of public improvements,”
replied the surgeon. “This piece of
sculpture, which looks something like a monument
when seen at a distance,” he continued, pointing to the
object at one end of the enclosure of the square, “is a
statue of the Virgin of Candelaria, representing her
appearance to the <i>Guanches</i>, as the original inhabitants
were called, and thus converting them to Christianity.”</p>

<p>The colossal statue is on the summit of the monument,
which has four other figures at the base. At the
other end of the plaza is a very handsome marble
cross, which symbolizes the sanctity of the city name.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>“This is the house in which was born the Marshal
O’Donnel, Duke of Tetuan,” said the doctor, as he
pointed to the building, a small and modest structure.</p>

<p>“He is a brave general in the French army. I was
reading about him the other day. He was taken prisoner
at Sedan last summer while we were in the north
of Europe,” said Scott.</p>

<p>“Now, that is not a creditable joke,” added the surgeon.
“You ought to know better.”</p>

<p>“But I don’t know any better.”</p>

<p>“You are thinking of Marshal McMahon. This is
O’Donnel, another man entirely,” interposed the doctor.</p>

<p>“It was not a joke, but a blunder,” said Scott, blushing.
“They have Irish names; and both of them seem
to be out of their element in France and Spain. But
who is O’Donnel, anyhow?”</p>

<p>“He isn’t McMahon, anyhow,—nor Gen. Howe.
His ancestors were Irish refugees, who came here after
the battle of the Boyne. He went into the Spanish
army, and was a colonel at the age of twenty-five.
He distinguished himself as a soldier, and for his services
in Morocco was made Duke of Tetuan, which is
a division of that country. He has had great influence
as a statesman, having been minister of war, and president
of the council. He had his ups and downs, as all
Spanish statesmen have. He has headed an insurrection,
and has been banished. He died in 1867. You
must have heard of him when you were in Spain.”</p>

<p>“I think I did, sir; but I have heard about so many
men, that I get them a little mixed.”</p>

<p>“Like the <i>plaza</i> and the <i>alameda</i> in all Spanish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>
towns, this square is the great resort of the people in
the evening. The band plays here, and the scene is
quite lively,” continued Dr. Winstock. “When I was
a young man I used to see a deal of flirting on this
square; but since I have grown older I don’t notice such
things. I was stationed on the coast of Africa,
in a sloop-of-war, looking out for slavers; and the ship
came up here to recruit the health of the men. One of
our officers was smitten with a Santa Cruz beauty; and
he adopted the custom of the country. He followed
her about the streets, dogged her steps, in a manner
that would have amounted to an outrage at home. At
last he obtained an introduction to her; but this was
hardly necessary, though his prejudices required it of
him. But he only saw her in the plaza, and in the
Prince Royal Square; and she evidently liked him as
well as he did her. Not till they were engaged was he
permitted by the custom of the islands to enter her
father’s house, or hotel it was in this instance; for she
was a <i>Canarienne</i>, and only a temporary resident.”</p>

<p>“Did the officer marry her?” asked Murray, with
deep interest.</p>

<p>“Of course you would not be satisfied to have me
omit the <i>denoûment</i> of the novel,” added the surgeon,
laughing. “He did marry her; and I think she is a
dignified matron in the city of Philadelphia at this
time.”</p>

<p>The party walked about the city till they had exhausted
its sights, which was soon done. The doctor
introduced his charge to the delicious chocolate to be
had at the cafés on the plaza; but some of them
declared that it was too thick, and preferred the ice-cream<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
made from the snows of the peak of Teneriffe.
The cicerone then proposed a long walk, which would
occupy the rest of the day.</p>

<p>“I am ready, for one; but what do you call a long
walk, doctor? Some folks think three miles is a long
walk; but I don’t apply the phrase to any thing less
than fifty miles,” replied Scott.</p>

<p>“I propose to go to Laguna, the ancient city of this
island. It is five miles distant; and, as the town is two
thousand feet above the sea, it will be up-hill all the
way. If you are too tired to walk back, you can return
in the <i>dilijencia</i>.”</p>

<p>The party gladly assented to the plan; and they
started out of the city. In a short time they left the
well-paved streets of the great road, which is fully
equal to the royal highways of Spain.</p>

<p>“Laguna is a summer resort for the wealthy people
of Santa Cruz; and the heat on the seashore, when
the wind comes from the coast of Africa, is intense,”
said the doctor, as the party trudged on their way.
“But it is not the most desirable place on the island,
for it is subject to heavy rains. Orotava, concerning
which I gave Mr. Mapps some information for his lecture,
is a much more desirable place; and one of these
days, when a railroad is built to it, the citizens will live
there in the summer, and do business in the city. We
shall have an opportunity to visit the place.”</p>

<p>“What in the world is that growing in that field?”
asked Scott, as he looked over the walls that bounded
the road.</p>

<p>“What do you suppose?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t the least idea; but the plants must be
sick, for they seem to be tied up in rags.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>“Those plants are cacti; and I think I have told
you something about them to-day,” added the doctor.
“The rags are tied about them to protect the insects,
for they are full of them. It takes about three months
for them to attain their growth, and be ready to lay eggs.
They furnish the principal occupation of the laboring-classes
since the failure of the vine. When I first
came along here, this road was bordered with extensive
and beautiful vineyards; but they have given place for
the present to this not very handsome plant, which was
brought here from Mexico.”</p>

<p>“Those are funny-looking houses!” exclaimed Murray,
as they came upon a little collection of dwellings
of the peasants.</p>

<p>“They are very comfortable houses for poor people,”
replied the doctor; “a great deal better than many of
the laboring-people of Spain occupy.”</p>

<p>Some of them were built of stone; others were evidently
composed of poles set in the ground; and in
the latter case the walls, as well as the roofs, were
thatched.</p>

<p>“All the poor people do not have houses as good as
these, but, like the gypsies of Granada, have to burrow
into the rocks to make caves for dwellings. But this
is a very soft climate, and the house is not of so much
consequence as in Russia or Norway.”</p>

<p>“There is a woman with a load on her head! it
looks like garden-sauce. There is another with a pile
of wood on her crown,” cried Scott.</p>

<p>“Domestic animals are not very plenty in these
islands; and the women seem to have a monopoly of
the carrying-trade,” continued the surgeon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>“Hi! Hi!” shouted Scott, as they turned a bend
in the winding road. “There are your beasts of burden!”</p>

<p>“What are they?” asked Sheridan.</p>

<p>“Camels; don’t you know them?”</p>

<p>“I never saw one before in my life,” replied the
captain of the Prince.</p>

<p>“Here is a train of them, each with his bell. We
are not far from the Great Desert, where these animals
do all the carrying; and a considerable number of
them have been brought to these islands.”</p>

<p>After a while the novelty of the scenes along the
road wore off; and some of them declared that the
country was not much different from Madeira. About
two o’clock in the afternoon they reached Laguna, and
spent a couple of hours in seeing its sights. A very
fine organ in the cathedral was shown to them; and in
another church there was a miraculous picture in which
the subject wept on proper occasions. They were
much interested in the museum, where they saw specimens
of the implements used by the aborigines, who
had no knowledge of the use of iron. Knives were
made of pieces of lava; and horns were used for
ploughs. The people embalmed the bodies of their
dead after the manner of the Egyptians; and mummies
enclosed in goat-skin were on exhibition.</p>

<p>About four the excursionists started on their return;
and all of them walked, for, if any were tired enough
to ride, they were too proud to say so. When they
had gone about half of the distance, the stage passed
them; but it immediately stopped, and Dona Maria
and her father stepped out of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>“Maria insists upon walking with the young gentlemen,”
said Don Roderigue apologetically.</p>

<p>“I am dead of that stage!” protested the maiden.</p>

<p>She placed herself at the side of Scott, and walked
along as briskly as any of the party. She wanted to
talk English; and she was very proud of the progress
she had made since the students had first come to her
father’s <i>quinta</i>. Of course there was no such thing as
fatigue after the fair girl joined the party. The officers
were inclined to rally Scott a good deal on account of
his relations with the fair Portuguese: but he did not
appear to be smitten; and, as she did not understand
English well enough to appreciate his humor, she was
not the company he liked best.</p>

<p>The next day another excursion was made into the
country in another direction; but it was about the same
thing as before. The students wanted to make the
ascent of the peak of Teneriffe; but the undertaking
was too difficult, if not too dangerous, for the principal
to sanction it. On the third day after the arrival of the
squadron, it sailed again for Las Palmas. A couple of
days were spent there; and the vessels proceeded to
the north side of the island of Teneriffe, and anchored
off the <i>Puerto de Orotava</i>.</p>

<p>Dr. Winstock was very anxious that the students
should visit this place. Dr. Phelps, the passenger in
the Marian, declared that he should spend the winter
there; and he was of the opinion that he should
bring a dozen patients with him, for, after he had
carefully examined the situation, he was satisfied that it
was superior to Fayal, Madeira, Nassau, or any other
place, as a health resort for persons with weak or diseased
lungs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>The doctor’s usual party walked out to the town,
which is only a couple of miles inland; and Dona
Maria insisted upon accompanying them.</p>

<p>“This town is enclosed by mountains, as you see, from
three to seven thousand feet high, on all sides except
the seaward. It is sheltered from all the bad winds,”
said Dr. Winstock.</p>

<p>“But this is April; and we can’t tell how it feels in
the winter,” suggested Dr. Phelps, who had joined his
professional friend.</p>

<p>“But I have been here in the winter: the glass never
falls below fifty, nor gets above eighty-two. It is the
most uniform climate in the world,” replied Dr. Winstock
with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>“But you mention thirty-two degrees variation.”</p>

<p>“You have over a hundred variation in the Northern
States. But I mentioned the rarest extremes. No average
for a month is below sixty-two, or above seventy-two.
An invalid may sleep all the year round with his
windows open; and fires are never needed.”</p>

<p>The two physicians talked over this to them interesting
subject; and the students walked about the fields and
the town. It was as near paradise as any thing on
earth can be.</p>

<p>After remaining at this place for a couple of days,
the fleet went to Santa Cruz de Palma for a day, and
then sailed for Funchal on the 29th of the month.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XX.<br>

<small>“A YANKEE SHIP AND A YANKEE CREW.”</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">MR. FRISBONE and his wife and Miss Rodwood
were none the worse for the benevolent service
they had rendered on board of the Castle William.
The small-pox patients, as stated before, had been separated
by the mate from the rest of the people in the
forward part of the vessel. The sanitary measures
devised by Mrs. Frisbone, and carried out by her husband,
had wrought a wonderful change on board; and,
when the vessel arrived at Portsmouth, the condition
of the sick had greatly improved. The quarantine regulations
were relaxed as much as possible in favor of
the devoted nurses; but the ladies, who had been more
exposed than the Prince, were not permitted to leave
the limits of the hospital for a few days.</p>

<p>As soon as the Ville d’Angers anchored in the
harbor of Portsmouth, Gregory sent a message by the
steward, that he wished to see the captain. As soon as
O’Hara had leisure to attend to the matter, he requested
Shakings to bring his prisoners into the cabin,
hoping they had repented of the folly which had induced
them to “stand out,” as they expressed it. The
boatswain promptly produced the mutineers, and, touching<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>
his cap, was about to retire; but O’Hara desired
him to remain.</p>

<p>Gregory appeared, looking more defiant, if possible,
than when he was committed. For nearly a week he
had been kept in his state-room. The captain had offered
to allow him and Clinch to take an airing on the
poop-deck every day for a couple of hours, under the
eye of the boatswain, who was not to permit them to
speak to any of the ship’s company; but both of them
indignantly declined the proposition,—they would not
go on deck as prisoners.</p>

<p>“As I seem to be subject to your will and pleasure,
O’Hara, I wish to say that you have carried this thing
about far enough,” said the ex-first officer, when he
came into the presence of the captain.</p>

<p>“That’s just my idea,” added Clinch, turning up his
nose to express his contempt for the young commander
of the steamer.</p>

<p>“If you wish to see me in order to intimidate me, I
have nothing to say,” replied the captain, with dignity;
but he was greatly disappointed at the tone and manner
of the mutineers.</p>

<p>“I think we were clearly in the right in refusing to
do duty when you were running away with the vessel,”
continued Gregory.</p>

<p>“I do not care to argue the matter,” added O’Hara.</p>

<p>“I want to know who is right.”</p>

<p>“The principal will decide that in due time.”</p>

<p>“The principal is not here to decide any thing.”</p>

<p>“We can only wait till we see him.”</p>

<p>“I don’t intend to wait!” said Gregory angrily. “I
shall go on shore.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>“At present the steamer is quarantined; and no one
is allowed to leave her,” answered O’Hara.</p>

<p>“That’s another scrape you’ve got us into!” blustered
the rebel.</p>

<p>The captain made no reply to this taunt.</p>

<p>“There has been no show for the officers from the
Josephine in this steamer,” continued Gregory. “Mr.
Shakings, I think you ought to see fair play, at least,
when an officer of your own ship is treated in this way.”</p>

<p>“All the boatswain has to do is to obey the captain’s
orders,” replied Shakings; but he looked as though he
had something else to say if the occasion should require
it.</p>

<p>“Come, Clinch, let’s go on shore,” said Gregory,
beginning to move towards the door.</p>

<p>“Mr. Shakings, these officers are still in your keeping,”
added the captain.</p>

<p>“There is no going on shore for any one in this
vessel,” interposed the stout forward officer, as he
placed himself in front of the rebels. “You will return
to your rooms.”</p>

<p>“I won’t do it!” protested Gregory savagely, as he
made a spring towards the door.</p>

<p>“I think you will, my beauty,” added the boatswain,
as he collared the rebel, and dragged him to his room.</p>

<p>Without any ceremony, he shoved him into the
apartment, and locked the door upon him. Clinch had
not the pluck to make a forcible resistance; and he
went to his room without the assistance of Shakings.</p>

<p>“I don’t see that I can do any thing else with Gregory
and Clinch,” said O’Hara, when the boatswain had
secured his prisoners.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>“I think you are using them very gently,” replied
Shakings. “Mr. Fluxion will keep them in the brig a
month for this, and send them out of the cabin with the
lowest numbers in the ship.”</p>

<p>“I only wish to keep them from leading any of the
other officers or seamen away from their duty,” added
O’Hara.</p>

<p>“There is not the least danger of that: every man
from the Josephine will stand by you to the end.”</p>

<p>As intimated in the newspaper the vice-principal had
read at Funchal, Mr. Frisbone was negotiating with the
owners of the Castle William for the settlement of the
salvage; but little progress was made till the discharge
of the Prince from the quarantine, which was done at
the end of a week. The vessel and cargo were acknowledged
to be worth ten thousand pounds; and the
Prince accepted one-half of this sum. The owners of
the Ville d’Angers were more exacting, and declined
to settle the claim. Proceedings had been instituted
as soon as the vessel arrived; and, a few days later,
the court decreed that one-half of her value should be
paid by the owners to the salvors. The vessel was to
be sold at public vendue to determine her value; and
the shrewd agent of the owners was satisfied that a
French craft, sold in an English port, would bring
but a mere song.</p>

<p>The Prince was discharged from quarantine in season
to attend the auction. The agent expected no
competition in the bidding. His first bid was four
thousand pounds; then the Prince added another thousand,
and continued to increase upon the agent till the
sum of thirteen thousand pounds was reached; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>
then the first bidder had a cold sweat, for his instructions
allowed him to bid no more. The steamer was
struck off to the Prince for “a thousand better.”</p>

<p>The agent was confounded, and the Prince was in
excellent humor. He had to pay only a half of the
purchase-money, for the other half belonged to the
salvors. But the agent had new instructions when it
was too late; and he offered the Prince another thousand,
and then two and three, for his bargain, but the
buyer declined to sell.</p>

<p>“What do you want of that steamer?” asked Mrs.
Frisbone, when he told her what he had done.</p>

<p>“I think we will all go to Madeira in her,” replied
Mr. Frisbone, laughing. “I have been bothered to
know what to do with the ship’s company of the
steamer; and this settles the question. Besides, the
vessel is worth more than I pay for her.”</p>

<p>The Prince hastened on board of the Ville d’Angers
to inform the officers what he had done, and to have
her prepared for the voyage to Funchal. Everybody
on board was pleased with the result of the Prince’s
operations, unless it was the prisoners in their state-rooms.</p>

<p>The steamer was immediately hauled into the dock,
her cargo taken out of her, for that had been sold “on
account of whom it might concern,” and the proceeds
had added over eight hundred pounds to the result of
the expedition to England. Then she ran up to
Southampton, where she coaled and took in a supply
of provisions on the most liberal scale. By the morning
of the 21st, she was ready to sail; and not a moment
was lost in getting under way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>The French and Italian firemen had been discharged,
and sent home by the agent of the owners. Another
set was employed for the voyage, and two young English
engineers were added to the force in the engine-room.
In fact, the vessel was fitted out as if she were
to go around the world. She had been ballasted so as
to put her into the best sailing-trim when the coal in
her bunkers should be reduced.</p>

<p>The article in the newspaper had drawn considerable
attention to the steamer; and when she sailed there
was quite a crowd to witness her departure.</p>

<p>“Where are you bound, captain?” asked a young
man, as O’Hara was about to get into the boat which
was waiting for him.</p>

<p>“To Funchal, in the island of Madeira,” replied the
young captain, hardly looking at the inquirer; for he
had been tormented with questions ever since he put
his foot on the shore.</p>

<p>The person who asked the question was not more
than twenty-two years of age, and was accompanied by
another young man about his own age. Both of them
were dressed in travelling suits of gray; and they
appeared to belong to the better class of English
people.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon for troubling you, captain,” persisted
the inquirer.</p>

<p>“If I can be of any service to you, I shall be happy;
but, upon my sowl, I am in a hurry,” replied O’Hara
pleasantly.</p>

<p>“It’s only a moment for another question. Could
you by any possibility take a couple of passengers
along with you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>“The steamer is not a passenger-vessel,” answered
the captain.</p>

<p>“I am well aware of that; but it would be a great
accommodation to us; for you see we lost the last
steamer to Funchal by a delay caused by a railway
accident.”</p>

<p>“I do not feel at liberty to take passengers; and I
shall be obliged to refer you to the agent of the principal,
Mr. Frisbone,” added O’Hara.</p>

<p>“This gentleman is Sir Philip Grayner, baronet,”
said the young man with the applicant for a passage.</p>

<p>O’Hara thought he was rather young to be a baronet,
but it was possible to succeed to the title at an
early age. But he was not particularly impressed by
the fact. The information had been imparted to him
as though it was confidential, and he made no use of it.</p>

<p>“Where can I find Mr. Frisbone?” asked the baronet,
renewing the attack.</p>

<p>“He is on board of the steamer.”</p>

<p>“And how soon do you sail?”</p>

<p>“In the course of an hour.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, captain,” replied Sir Philip Grayner.
“The gentleman with me is Lord Fillgrove,” he added
in a low tone.</p>

<p>“Another sprig of nobility,” thought O’Hara, as he
descended to the boat.</p>

<p>The well-trained crew gave way at the order of the
coxswain, and the cutter was soon alongside of the Ville
d’Angers. The vessel was only waiting for the pilot;
but the time fixed for him to be on board had not
yet arrived. The cutter was hoisted up at the davits,
and secured for the voyage. The other cutter had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
not yet returned from the shore, where she had gone
with a party of the students who had liberty to visit
the city. Leave had been freely granted; and in no
case had it been abused, so far as the officers were
aware. If any of the young men had drank beer,
or other dangerous fluids, their condition when they
returned did not indicate such indulgence.</p>

<p>About half an hour after the return of the captain,
a boat containing the two applicants for passage to
Funchal, with their bags and luggage, came alongside.
The bringing of their baggage implied that they had a
strong expectation of obtaining what they desired. They
were permitted to come on board, and presented their
application to the Prince.</p>

<p>“We are entirely willing to pay our passage,” said
the baronet.</p>

<p>“By all means, we shall do that,” added the one with
the lordly title.</p>

<p>“That is no particular object with us,” replied the
Prince. “We should not take you for the money you
may pay.”</p>

<p>“We will at least pay for our diet and the wines we
drink,” said Sir Philip.</p>

<p>“We don’t sell rum on this steamer,” replied Mr.
Frisbone, very decidedly. “If you can’t get along
without wine, I think you had better take passage in
some other vessel. We don’t furnish any thing to drink
for anybody; and, what’s more, we don’t allow any wine
or liquor to be used about the steamer.”</p>

<p>“That’s a matter of no consequence,” added Sir
Philip, looking at his companion, and giving him a sly
wink when he was sure he was not observed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>“We don’t care if we never have any thing in the
shape of wine or liquor,” the young lord agreed.</p>

<p>“What’s your name?” asked the Prince bluntly of
the first speaker.</p>

<p>“This gentleman is Sir Philip Grayner,” said his
lordship.</p>

<p>“And my friend is Lord Fillgrove,” added the baronet.</p>

<p>“Then you are dooks and lords,” continued Mr.
Frisbone; but he seemed to be pleased at the idea of
meeting them.</p>

<p>“My friend is a viscount,” replied Sir Philip.</p>

<p>“And mine is a baronet,” said Lord Fillgrove.</p>

<p>“All right!” exclaimed Mr. Frisbone, in his usual
loud tone. “I am an American Prince myself.”</p>

<p>The Prince talked with Capt. O’Hara and with
Capt. Fairfield about the matter; and it was agreed
that the passengers would be a pleasant addition to the
ship’s company. There were some spare state-rooms;
for the space between decks, called the “second cabin,”
had been fitted up for the crew, and it was a very light
and airy place for them. They preferred it to the main
cabin; and it was more conducive to good discipline to
have the officers farther removed from the seamen.</p>

<p>Each of the passengers took his choice of the state-rooms
not in use. The Prince introduced them to his
wife and her sister under their full titles.</p>

<p>“This is a very unexpected pleasure, Prince Frisbone,”
said Sir Philip. “I was not aware that we were
to have the pleasure of ladies’ society on the voyage.”</p>

<p>“Prince Frisbone!” exclaimed the worthy machinist,
laughing heartily. “That sounds odd.”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon; but I think you told me you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>
were an American Prince; and, as you did not dispute
my title, I am not disposed to deny your claim,” answered
Sir Philip.</p>

<p>“I suppose your title is a little more regular than
mine; but we won’t quarrel about these trifles,” added
the Prince. “This is now a ‘Yankee ship and a Yankee
crew;’ and I have an idea that one man is as good
as another on board of her.”</p>

<p>“No doubt of it; but I perceive that there is a great
difference between the officers and the seamen,” suggested
Lord Fillgrove.</p>

<p>“Not a bit of difference. No. 24 is just as good as
the captain,” protested the American nobleman.</p>

<p>“But one commands, and the other obeys.”</p>

<p>“That’s true; but we don’t have any classes of citizens.
The day-laborer on town-meeting day is the equal
of the man worth a million that hires him; and any
fellow before the mast in this vessel may be captain of
her the very next month. Here is Capt. O’Hara: when
he was at this port last, he was a seaman; and next
month he may be a seaman again.”</p>

<p>“I hope not,” said O’Hara, laughing. “But I heard
that the principal and the faculty were getting up a new
way to fill the offices on board of the vessels of the
squadron; and some of us may slip up when it is applied.”</p>

<p>“It’s all very democratic,” added Lord Fillgrove.</p>

<p>The coming of the pilot put an end to the conversation,
though the two young “sprigs of nobility” made
themselves as agreeable as possible to the ladies, whom
they escorted to the hurricane-deck so as to afford them
an opportunity to observe the scenery of “Southampton<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>
Water” and “The Solent,” as the steamer went to
sea.</p>

<p>The anchor had been heaved up to a short stay; and,
as soon as the pilot was on the deck, the order was
given to man the capstan again. The young tars were
wide awake, and the pilot said he had never seen a
steamer better handled than the Ville d’Angers was on
this occasion.</p>

<p>In a couple of hours the steamer was off the Needles,
and the pilot was discharged. Capt. O’Hara was
his own navigator, though Tom Speers and first officer
Lawring also worked up the problems, and drew off the
courses from the chart, to verify the captain’s work.
The first course was from the Needles, the point of
“departure,” to Ushant. The weather was delightful,
and all on board were happy except the two malecontents
in their state-rooms. The extra engineers were
intelligent and agreeable men, and the firemen were a
great improvement upon the French and Italian ones.</p>

<p>Gregory and Clinch had several times been offered
the liberty of the deck, under the charge of the boatswain;
and the offer had been declined. But the
captain and the instructor did not consider it prudent
to allow them to hold any communication with the officers
and seamen of the vessel, for Gregory was still
in a mood to foment a mutiny.</p>

<p>The steward who carried their meals to the prisoners
gave them the current news of the day, so far as he
obtained it himself; and they were tolerably well posted.
After the sale of the steamer to the Prince, the
aspect of the case began to change, as the mutineers
viewed it. They had expected that the Ville d’Angers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>
would be given up to the owners, and the ship’s
company sent to Madeira in a passenger-steamer.
That had been the talk before the mutiny. Gregory
was confident that the change from the vessel to the
packet would afford them an opportunity to escape
from the rule of Capt. O’Hara and the instructor.</p>

<p>The ex-first officer was the son of a rich man, an
Englishman who had been naturalized in New York.
He had a letter of credit for a large amount, and he
was fully determined not to return to the squadron.
This hope faded away when the steward told him the
steamer had been purchased by the Prince, and would
sail for Madeira as soon as possible. He was appalled
at the idea. He was sure Mr. Fluxion would degrade
him to the lowest number in the Josephine; and he
was too proud and haughty to tolerate for an instant
the thought of such a humiliation.</p>

<p>He wanted to consult with Clinch about the present
situation. He knew that the state-room of his fellow-conspirator
was next to his own; but he dared not
attempt to converse with him through the partition,
lest they should be heard by the officers in the cabin,
and another room be assigned to one of them. When
the steamer began to move, he listened attentively at
the door; but no sound came from that direction.
The bull’s-eye in his room was open, and he could
hear voices on the deck above him.</p>

<p>He knocked on the partition to attract the attention
of Clinch; and he had often done so before, though
the conspirators had been unable to make each other
understand more than a few words. His companion
in misery promptly replied to his call.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>“Make a hole in the partition,” said he; and he
rapped several times to indicate the place for it.</p>

<p>“All right,” replied Clinch.</p>

<p>But they had to repeat what they said several times
before they could be understood. Gregory had given
his present plan careful consideration. He had selected
a spot behind the dressing-case that was fastened
to the bulkhead. With his pocket-knife he had
removed the screws from the case, and arranged it so
that he could restore it at an instant’s notice.</p>

<p>Clinch’s dressing-case was on the other side of the
partition, and the aperture to be made could be concealed
on Clinch’s side in the same manner as on his
own. As soon as the case was removed, he went to
work with his knife. The partition was a double one,
composed of boards extending diagonally, but from
opposite angles in the two rooms.</p>

<p>After half an hour’s diligent work he had cut a hole
half an inch in diameter through one thickness of the
partition. He had spread a towel under the place
where he was working, to receive the chips, so that they
should not betray him. It was not so easy to cut
through the second board; it could be better done by
Clinch on the other side. Taking one of the gimlet-screws
he had removed from the dressing-case, he
turned it with his knife till he had passed it through
the second board. He then unscrewed it, and enlarged
the hole with a small blade of his knife, till it
would admit the lead pencil he carried in his pocket.</p>

<p>The dressing-case consisted of a looking-glass, under
which was a rack for bottles and glasses, and a
couple of small drawers. He had made the hole<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>
where the back of one of these drawers had been.
With the lead pencil, he pushed the drawer in Clinch’s
room out as far as the length of the implement used
would permit. His fellow-conspirator observed the
movement of the drawer, and removed it from the case.
He saw the hole, and fully comprehended the plan of
his friend.</p>

<p>“Take out the screws from the dressing-case,” said
Gregory, with his mouth at the aperture.</p>

<p>Clinch complied with the request without making
any reply; for he was afraid he should be heard, and
the plan spoiled before it was carried out.</p>

<p>“All right,” said he, when he could get his mouth
close to the hole.</p>

<p>“Cut out the hole till it is as large as on this side.
Put your towel down so as to save the chips,” replied
Gregory, in a low tone.</p>

<p>Clinch went to work, and in a short time he had
made the aperture of the same size all the way through.
But half an inch was rather small, and they enlarged it
to an inch, which would enable them to talk with less
danger of being heard. The dressing-cases were then
restored to their former positions. Gregory had improved
upon his plan as the work proceeded; and it
was necessary to remove only the drawers on each side
when they wished to talk together. Each could call
the attention of the other by shoving out the drawer.
If any one came to the door of either state-room while
the contrivance was in use, it could be concealed by
restoring the drawer.</p>

<p>“How are you now?” asked Gregory, when the
cases had been replaced.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>“All right! this is a first-class arrangement,” replied
Clinch.</p>

<p>“Put your mouth close-up to the case, and speak very
low,” added Gregory, who was as much pleased with
his invention as though it had been a useful machine.</p>

<p>“I will,” answered Clinch in a whisper. “Can you
hear me?”</p>

<p>“Very distinctly. The steamer is in still water now;
and we may have to speak louder when she gets to
sea.”</p>

<p>“I heard some strange voices in the cabin before the
steamer sailed. Do you know who they are?” asked
Clinch.</p>

<p>“I don’t. I have not heard them since the screw
began to turn,” answered Gregory. “I believe I have
heard one of the voices before; but I can’t think whose
it is now.”</p>

<p>“It may be some friend of yours. Your folks are
English.”</p>

<p>“But they all live in Lancashire; and none of them
are likely to be in this part of England.”</p>

<p>“We can find out who they are when the steward
brings our dinner,” added Clinch.</p>

<p>“I don’t suppose it makes much difference to us who
the strangers are. Things look black enough on this
side of the house,” said Gregory, in a rather desponding
tone.</p>

<p>“So they do on this side,” replied Clinch. “We can
be a little more sociable than we have been; and that’s
all.”</p>

<p>“I don’t give it up yet.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>“Give what up?”</p>

<p>“Getting out of this scrape.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see any way out of it.”</p>

<p>A footstep in the cabin caused them both to insert
the drawers, and close the conversation.</p>

<small>THE SPRIGS OF NOBILITY.</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">EVERY thing went well with the vessel and her
management. The officers and seamen were faithful
and attentive to their duty, so far as those in charge
could discover. The weather was all that could be
desired; and the Ville d’Angers logged from twelve
to fifteen knots an hour. The quarter-watches were
amply sufficient for the duty of the ship, and the four
engineers made it easy work for Alexander and Richards.</p>

<p>The Prince had superintended the provisioning of
the steamer, and he had done it in the most lavish
manner. The fare was better than that furnished on
the vessels of the squadron, good as that was; and the
students could not help speaking of the fact.</p>

<p>“We fare better than I ever did at the best hotels
in Europe,” said O’Hara, when they were seated at
dinner.</p>

<p>“You deserve good feed,” said the Prince, laughing.
“This has been a big expedition we undertook. I was
figuring it up before we sailed; and I found we had
made twenty-eight hundred pounds, besides the value of
the Dangers.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>“Besides what?” demanded Mrs. Frisbone.</p>

<p>“The Dangers. Don’t you know the name of the
steamer you sail in, the Yankee ship with the Yankee
crew?” answered the Prince, who pronounced French
as it was written, in spite of the frequent admonitions
of his educated wife.</p>

<p>“The Ville d’Angers,” added the lady, pronouncing
correctly the name of the steamer.</p>

<p>“I should have to have my tongue split like a crow,
before I could say that; and I don’t mean to try. The
Dangers suits me better,” retorted the Prince good-naturedly.
“We were in a good many dangers while we
were in her at first; and that’s the best name in the
world for her. I was saying I had twenty-eight hundred
pounds, besides the Dangers, all made out of this cruise
to the nor’ard; and, as the young gentlemen have
done all the work, I was determined that they should
live like fighting-cocks while I had any thing to do
with them.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Mr. Frisbone,” added O’Hara. “I
think we are all in condition to appreciate good living.
What are you going to do with this steamer after you
have returned us all to the vessels of the squadron?”</p>

<p>“That will be for the principal to say. The steamer
belongs to him, and not to me; for it was one of his
squadron that picked her up,” replied the Prince. “I
think he had better use her as one of the vessels of his
fleet, and sell out his sailing-vessels. It won’t be
many years before sails, except with steam, will go out
of fashion.”</p>

<p>“She will accommodate as many as the two schooners,
after she has been fitted up for the purpose,” continued<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>
the captain. “She is nearly as fast as the
Prince; and, if we had been in her when we left Gibraltar,
we should have sailed with her.”</p>

<p>“Upon my word, I should have liked to be a student
in such a vessel when I was a youngster,” said Sir
Philip Grayner, who sat at the table about opposite the
state-room of Gregory.</p>

<p>“You are not much more than a youngster now,”
added the Prince, laughing at the cool way of the
baronet.</p>

<p>“I am two and twenty,” replied Sir Philip.</p>

<p>“Then you are not much more than a year older
than Mr. Speers, the second officer; and he is a millionnaire
at that.”</p>

<p>“A millionnaire!” exclaimed the baronet.</p>

<p>“Please not mention that, Mr. Frisbone,” interposed
Tom, blushing.</p>

<p>“It isn’t your fault, my boy; and I don’t blame you
for it,” added the Prince. “He is more than that, Sir
Philip: he is a three-millionnaire.”</p>

<p>Tom’s secret had come out in spite of the vigilance
with which he had guarded it. The sprigs of nobility
made themselves very intimate with him; and all the
students wanted to know about it, for most of them
could recollect how careful he was of the small store
of money he possessed.</p>

<p>“A millionnaire, is he?” said Gregory, in the state-room,
for the open-work above the door enabled him
to hear every word that was said in that part of the
cabin. “And he is a great crony with O’Hara.”</p>

<p>“I should like to get in with such a fellow,” replied
Clinch. “But what are we going to do with ourselves?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>
I have had about enough of this life in a state-room.”</p>

<p>“So have I, to be entirely candid,” added Gregory.
“The fellows are having a magnificent time, and we
are here under lock and key.”</p>

<p>“Are you going to back down?”</p>

<p>“There are two kinds of back-downs; and it makes
some difference which one you mean. I am not going
to kiss O’Hara’s great toe, or any thing of that sort;
but I am willing to come down a little for the sake of
getting out of this scrape.”</p>

<p>“All right. Tell the steward that we want to see
the captain; and you needn’t be so unutterably grand
as you were the last time you saw him,” replied Clinch.</p>

<p>“I meant to treat him with proper contempt; and,
if I ever get hold of him, I shall be even with him in
some way,” blustered Gregory.</p>

<p>“That’s all gas!” exclaimed Clinch, who was rather
disgusted with the lofty ways of his companion in
rebellion. “What’s the use of talking in that way?
O’Hara has the weather-gauge of you, and you can’t do
any thing.”</p>

<p>“I know I can’t now, while he has Shakings to fight
his battles for him,” growled Gregory.</p>

<p>“He does just as the principal and the vice-principals
do: they never touch a fellow with their own
hands; they called on the boatswains.”</p>

<p>“If the boatswain had been out of the way, I would
have made an end of O’Hara’s reign. I am sure I
could have got about all the fellows from the Josephine
to join our party.”</p>

<p>“So much the bigger fool you, for standing out before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>
you had said any thing to the fellows. Even Stokes
backed square down when it came to the scratch.”</p>

<p>“I was feeling very badly when I did it. That Burgundy
did not agree with me; it made me as cross
and sour as a baby at midnight. I did not intend to
do any thing till the moment came when I did it.”</p>

<p>“It is no use of grumbling about what is past and
gone. We are in the scrape; and the question is, how
shall we get out of it?” said Clinch, somewhat softened
by the confession of his friend.</p>

<p>Gregory told how he intended to manage the matter
when the steamer was given up; but this plan had
been spoiled by the purchase of the vessel. The one
thing he dreaded was being returned to the Josephine.
He was conscious that he had been guilty of
gross disobedience and insubordination. He had no
confidence whatever in the excuse he had offered, that
O’Hara was running away with the steamer, and disregarding
the instructions of the senior vice-principal.
This plea was only an excuse for rebelling against the
authority of the captain; and he was sure it would not
be accepted by Mr. Fluxion. The voyage to England
had been a decided success; and the enterprise had
been fully indorsed by all the adults on board.</p>

<p>It was the feeling that he had been snubbed by
O’Hara, that the captain had not “made enough” of
him, which had excited his wrath. He had come on
board of the Ville d’Angers with the expectation that
the voyage was to be a sort of pleasure-excursion; and
the recitations and the quarter-watches, which practically
transferred the work and the discipline of the
squadron to the steamer, were exceedingly distasteful to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>
him. But the Burgundy was responsible for his mutinous
conduct; and without that he might have got
along with the minor difficulty in his path.</p>

<p>He could not tolerate the idea of returning to the
Josephine, and taking the penalty of his misconduct.
He was ready to resort to the most desperate expedient
to avoid the merited punishment. Since the sale
of the vessel, he had been cudgelling his brain to
devise the plan. He had hoped to become the captain
of the Josephine in due time; but now he had
given up the idea: the Burgundy had robbed him of
all his expectations in connection with the academy
squadron. He must get away, and keep away from it.</p>

<p>Clinch listened to all this long story, and confessed
that he was in the same boat as his companion. But
his father was not a rich man; and he could not cruise
all over the world, for the want of the means. But
Gregory declared that he had money enough to take
them both around the world; and, as long as his friend
would stick by him, he should want for nothing.
Whatever they did, they were to stick together.</p>

<p>At supper-time Gregory, who did all the planning
and scheming, had not settled upon any course of
action. The officers of one watch and the passengers
were at the table in the cabin. The prisoners, whose
time hung heavily on their hands, listened attentively
at the doors of their rooms to the conversation. Gregory
heard the voice which he believed he had heard
before, as he told Clinch. It sounded even more familiar
than at dinner.</p>

<p>“You are going off on your travels, I suppose,” said
the Prince.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>“No, sir: I am going to Funchal on a bit of a lark,”
replied the person with the well-known voice. “I have
long wanted to go there; but I could not get away from
the university till this spring. I am through with
schools for the rest of my lifetime; and now I am going
to enjoy myself, if I can.”</p>

<p>“Are you going to stop long in Madeira, Sir Philip?”
asked the Prince.</p>

<p>“Sir Philip!” exclaimed Gregory to himself; and
this was the first time he had heard the name of either
of the passengers.</p>

<p>“Only till I get tired of the island. It may be a
week, or a month,” added the baronet.</p>

<p>“Where are you going then?” inquired the Prince.</p>

<p>“I haven’t the least idea. I am opposed to laying
out a pleasure-excursion in advance.”</p>

<p>“We shall go wherever it suits our fancy to go when
we have done the island,” added Lord Fillgrove.</p>

<p>“Lord Fillgrove and I are perfectly agreed on this
trip,” said Sir Philip. “We were in the university together,
and we have considered the matter for years.”</p>

<p>“Lord Fillgrove!” exclaimed Gregory, as he heard
the name of the other passenger.</p>

<p>He listened to the conversation till the close of supper;
and, after the steward had given him his evening
meal, he opened communication with his fellow-prisoner.</p>

<p>“Did you hear the names of the two passengers,
Clinch?” he asked, when his friend had placed his ear
at the opening in the partition.</p>

<p>“I did: one is a lord, and the other is a sir,” replied
Clinch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>“Sir Philip Grayner is my cousin; and I had the
biggest lark with him I ever had in my life. It was
before I joined the squadron, when I went over to
England with my father on a visit.”</p>

<p>“Who’s the other fellow?”</p>

<p>“He is a friend of my cousin; and I met him in Lancaster
when I was there. He is the eldest son of an
earl; and I believe they call him a viscount. He is
addressed as Lord Fillgrove.”</p>

<p>“Do they know you are on board?” asked Clinch,
much interested in the information conveyed to him.</p>

<p>“I don’t know: I don’t suppose they do. But we
must get out of this place as soon as we can; and I
know my cousin will help us all he can.”</p>

<p>“It is easy enough to say, get out; but how will you
do it?”</p>

<p>“We must back down,—come clear down,” replied
Gregory earnestly.</p>

<p>“That don’t sound like you, Dave,” added Clinch.</p>

<p>“Of course you know what I mean,” continued the
chief mutineer, apparently annoyed at the remark of
his friend. “We are not going to become chaplain’s
lambs, or any thing of that sort.”</p>

<p>“But you must go down on your knees to Capt.
O’Hara, the mighty one, who is the supreme authority
on board of the Ville d’Angers,” answered Clinch,
in a contemptuous tone.</p>

<p>“I will even do that, if it is necessary,” added Gregory.</p>

<p>“I won’t!” exclaimed Clinch.</p>

<p>“Don’t be a fool! we must get out of these state-rooms;
and that’s the only way to do it. But I don’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>
think O’Hara will be very hard on us. Of course he
won’t attempt to punish us. He has offered us the
freedom of the deck under the eye of the boatswain;
and we must accept that, if we can’t get any thing better.
I want to be where I can have a talk with my
cousin. I don’t expect O’Hara will restore us to our
positions as first and third officers, for those places are
now filled by fellows from the Josephine. All I want
is to get out of this state-room: don’t you see?”</p>

<p>“I see; but I don’t want to go down on my knees to
a fellow from the Tritonia. I will do any thing you
say; and I can stand it if you can.”</p>

<p>“I can stand it well enough when the thing is done
for a purpose,” replied Gregory very cheerfully. “I
will do the talking when we are before the mighty
Capt. O’Hara. Leave it to me.”</p>

<p>Clinch was entirely willing to leave it to his friend.</p>

<p>“I have been figuring things up a little since the
steamer sailed,” continued Gregory. “What day of the
month is this, Clinch?”</p>

<p>“The 21st: I heard one of the fellows at the table
say so at dinner,” replied Clinch.</p>

<p>“Good! then we shall not get to Funchal till the
26th or 27th. At that time the squadron will have
been out over a fortnight, nearly three weeks. I have
no idea that Mr. Lowington will stay in Funchal so
long,” argued Gregory. “He will start the fleet for
the Western Islands, or wherever he is going next, and
leave orders there for the absentees to follow him.”</p>

<p>“That may be; and you think he will be gone when
we get there?” mused Clinch.</p>

<p>“I am almost sure of it. He will get news by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>
regular steamer from the Ville d’Angers; and he won’t
wait for her. When we reach Madeira, we must get
away from the vessel. I am sure my cousin will help
us out; and we will join them on their trip.”</p>

<p>This was entirely satisfactory to Clinch; and, as soon
as he saw the bearing of the “back-down,” he was
willing even to kiss O’Hara’s toe in order to forward
the plan.</p>

<p>Gregory was an inventive genius; and, before the
first half of the last dog-watch had expired, he had
improved upon his plan, and decided to put it in operation
at once. He was so impatient that he was not
willing to wait till the next day. He did not feel quite
as well as usual; and he really wished he was a little
sicker than he was. This suggested a way to get at
the captain at once. He could easily make himself a
little sicker than he was. He had formerly been subject
to a certain kind of headache; and he carried in
his bag a medicine the family physician had given
him before he left home. It always produced nausea
to a considerable degree. He took a dose of it; and
in a short time he was sick in real earnest. Possibly
his confinement in his room had made him more susceptible
to nausea.</p>

<p>He knocked loudly on his door; and, when the
steward came to inquire what he wanted, he stated that
he was sick, and desired to go on deck. The captain
was consulted, and the order was promptly given for
Shakings to conduct him to the deck. The acting
head steward offered his services, and he received
every attention his case required. When Mrs. Frisbone
heard that he was ill, she went to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>“I have been feeling badly for some time; and I
took some medicine which our family doctor gave me,”
said the sufferer.</p>

<p>“I think it is quite enough to make one sick, to be
shut up in that state-room as you have been, Mr.
Gregory,” replied the lady, when she had examined
into the condition of the invalid.</p>

<p>“I am generally very well, and I have not had occasion
to take any of this medicine for a long time,”
added Gregory.</p>

<p>Mrs. Frisbone spoke to the captain about the case,
and expressed her opinion in regard to it.</p>

<p>“I have several times offered to let him go on deck
for an hour or two, and he has refused to do so,” replied
O’Hara.</p>

<p>“Certainly it was his own fault that he has not had
any more air and exercise,” added the lady.</p>

<p>“I am willing to go still farther,” continued O’Hara,
who did not wish to injure the health of any student,
however guilty he might be. “I will see him in the
morning, and will endeavor to give both Gregory and
Clinch more liberty than they have had, and without
the assistance of the boatswain, for they refused the
offer because Shakings was to have charge of them.”</p>

<p>The patient was permitted to stay on deck as long
as he pleased; but he did not see Sir Philip Grayner,
who was playing whist in the cabin with the Prince and
the ladies. When he went to his room, and was locked
in as usual, he told Clinch what he had been about.</p>

<p>At eight bells the next morning, O’Hara sent for the
two prisoners, and they were brought into the cabin by
the boatswain. Both of the “sprigs” were there; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>
Sir Philip looked him fairly in the eye, but made no
sign whatever that he knew him, or had ever seen him.
Gregory thought it very strange that his cousin did not
recognize him, especially when Capt. O’Hara called
him by name.</p>

<p>“I hope you are better this morning, Mr. Gregory,”
said O’Hara; and he expected a rude, if not an insulting
reply.</p>

<p>“I am much better, I thank you, Capt. O’Hara,”
answered the prisoner. “I wish to say that I am sick,
and I can’t stand it to be locked up in that room, now
that the port has to be closed.”</p>

<p>Gregory spoke in a respectful tone; and O’Hara
could not but notice the change in his manner.</p>

<p>“I am very sorry that it became necessary to confine
you to your room; but I have tried to have you take
air and exercise,” added O’Hara. “I understand you
to object to the attendance of Mr. Shakings.”</p>

<p>“I did object; but I do not now. I am willing to
do any thing you deem proper, and to confess”—</p>

<p>“I shall not try your case, Mr. Gregory; and it is
quite unnecessary for you to make any acknowledgments
to me,” interposed the captain. “I have a proposition
to make to you and Mr. Clinch, which I hope
will not be considered humiliating. Both of you shall
have the liberty of the vessel, provided you will promise
not to speak to any officer or seaman of the steamer.”</p>

<p>“It is a very liberal offer; and I am much obliged
to you for it, captain. I thankfully accept the proposition,
and promise not to speak to any officer or seaman
of the vessel,” replied Gregory.</p>

<p>“I will do the same,” added Clinch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>“I will modify the condition so far as to provide that
you hold no private conversation with the officers and
seamen. I do not wish to prevent you from speaking
on the ordinary topics of the day. You will take your
meals with the officers in the cabin; and you are free
to talk as much as you please at the table.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, captain,” replied Gregory meekly.</p>

<p>“Sir Philip, this is Mr. Gregory,” said the captain,
as the young baronet was about to pass them.</p>

<p>“Mr. Gregory, I am happy to make your acquaintance,”
replied Sir Philip with no sign of recognition;
and the baronet passed out of the cabin.</p>

<p>Gregory was utterly confounded at the conduct of
his cousin. The captain soon after presented Lord
Fillgrove, whom the ex-first officer had met not more
than two years before; but he was as innocent of all
knowledge of him as his cousin had been. Neither of
them seemed to be inclined to cultivate his acquaintance,
perhaps because he was under a cloud just then.
After breakfast Gregory went on deck, where he met
the “sprigs” again.</p>

<p>“You don’t know me, do you, Phil?” demanded
Gregory, with considerable indignation in his tones.</p>

<p>“Of course I know you, Dave,” replied Sir Philip
coldly, as he looked about him to ascertain what
officers were in sight. But none were on the poop-deck;
for all of them not on duty were attending to
their studies.</p>

<p>“You seem to be as stiff as though you were not
glad to see me,” added Gregory.</p>

<p>“I came on board of this ship on purpose to get you
out of this scrape, and I will do it yet; but we had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>
better seem not to know each other very well,” replied
Sir Philip, gazing at the blue sky above him. “Wait
till we get to Funchal. I want you to go with Fillgrove
and me on an excursion of a year or two.”</p>

<p>“All right, Phil. I thought by your actions that you
intended to cut me,” added Gregory, seeing the wisdom
of his cousin’s precaution. “I want to get out of the
academy squadron.”</p>

<p>“You shall; and we will have a bigger lark than we
did when you were in England before.”</p>

<p>“That was a large time,” said Gregory, recalling with
pleasure the “spree,” for that was what it was.</p>

<p>“I met a fellow by the name of Stokes in Southampton,
who belonged to the ship; and I asked him about
you. He told me you were kept a prisoner in your
state-room because you wouldn’t kiss the captain’s great
toe; and I am here to attend to your case,” continued
the baronet, still looking at the sky. “But let us be
any thing but friends.”</p>

<p>Gregory assented; but during the rest of the voyage
he had some long talks with him. In four days more,
the Ville d’Angers arrived at Funchal,—on the morning
of the 27th; but the fleet was not there.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXII.<br>

<small>WHAT THE STUDENTS SAW IN THE AZORES.</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">ON the last day of the month, the academy squadron
sailed into the harbor of Funchal, arriving
from the Canaries in advance of the mail-steamer which
sailed from Southampton six days before. The vessels
anchored off the Loo Rock; for it was intended by the
principal to remain only long enough to take on board
the ship’s company of the Ville d’Angers, when the
mail-steamer came in.</p>

<p>She did not appear till afternoon; and no one went
on shore till that time, not even Don Roderigue, his
wife and daughter; for they had been so hospitably
entertained, that they were disposed to prolong their
stay on board of the Marian as long as possible. The
family were even considering an invitation of Judge
Rodwood to visit the Western Islands in the steam-yacht.
At two o’clock, when the mail-steamer came
into the harbor, Mr. Fluxion and Mr. Pelham, each in
the first cutter of the vessel under his charge, went to
the packet, to receive his portion of the Ville d’Angers’
ship’s company.</p>

<p>The two vice-principals went on board of the steamer
as soon as it was allowable to do so. Great was their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>
astonishment when the purser informed them that no
such passengers as those they described were on board
of the packet.</p>

<p>“They went to Portsmouth in the steamer Ville
d’Angers, towing the wreck of the Castle William,”
added Mr. Fluxion.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes! I know all about them!” exclaimed the
purser. “They picked up the steamer; and she was
sold to settle the salvage. The odd gentleman they
called a prince bought her; and the ship’s company
which brought her there sailed in her for Funchal on
the 21st of the month, three days ahead of this packet.”</p>

<p>Mr. Pelham was sent to the American Prince to report
this news, while Mr. Fluxion hastened up to the
city to see the agent of the principal, who was his
banker. This gentleman informed the vice-principal
that Capt. O’Hara had visited his office three days
before; and, when the banker told him the fleet had
gone to the Canary Islands, he had departed, leaving
no intimation of his intentions. On inquiry later in
the day, he learned that the Ville d’Angers had sailed
for Santa Cruz, Teneriffe. Mr. Fluxion hastened to the
principal with this intelligence. Mr. Lowington was
confounded by it.</p>

<p>“Then they are still roaming over the ocean in that
steamer,” said he. “I have no agent or banker in
Santa Cruz; and I left no word there as to the destination
of the squadron. O’Hara will not be able to obtain
any information as to where we are, or are to be.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see that any harm can come to them: they
are in a good vessel, and have proved, by their voyage
to England and back, that they know how to handle it,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span>
said Mr. Fluxion, laughing. “I suppose Mr. Frisbone
is still with them; at any rate, Capt. Fairfield is; and
they are attending to their studies, the same as they
would if they were on board of the schooners.”</p>

<p>After thinking the matter over, Mr. Lowington was
reconciled to the situation. The Ville d’Angers had
been gone three days and a half from Madeira. It was
time for her to return, even if she followed the fleet to
Palma, which had been the last island the squadron
had visited. The students were allowed to go on shore
in the afternoon, and escort Don Roderigue and his
family to their home. A feast was provided for them
in the evening, and Dona Maria was as fascinating as
ever. But in the evening they bade the family adieu,
not expecting to see them again, for they had decided
not to go to the Azores in the Marian.</p>

<p>At noon on the following day, as the Ville d’Angers
did not appear, the squadron was ordered to sail at
once for the Western Islands. The principal left
orders with his banker for the steamer to follow him
if she put into Madeira again. It was the first day of
the month, and the offices were distributed on board
of the Prince; but, as one-third of the ship’s company of
the other vessels were absent, the award of positions was
assigned to an early day after the arrival of the Ville
d’Angers’ people.</p>

<p>“But what shall I do?” asked Judge Rodwood,
when the principal had issued the order to sail at once.</p>

<p>“You can do as you think best, judge,” answered
Mr. Lowington. “If you run over to the Canaries
again, you may possibly find this truant steamer.”</p>

<p>“As we have just come from there, I don’t care to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>
go again,” replied the judge. “I think I shall follow
you; for I am sure the truants will find you in the end.
I am out for a cruise; and I intended to visit all these
islands on my way home.”</p>

<p>The Marian followed the squadron; and, after a
comfortable run of four days, the fleet anchored off the
town of Horta, in the island of Fayal. As the wind was
east, the vessels had smooth water; and the students
were assembled at once to hear Professor Mapps’s talk
about the Azores.</p>

<p>“The Azores are about two thousand miles from
Boston, the direction being a little south of east. And
the Prince or the Marian would make the voyage in
six days, while our schooners, with a smashing breeze
all the way, would do it in eight or nine. These islands
have received various names; and people now call
them indifferently the ‘Western’ and the ‘Azores.’
They are the most western of the four groups of
islands lying nearest to the Western Continent; and
this explains the first name. The other word comes
from the Portuguese <i>açor</i>, a hawk; and I suppose the
early settlers found that bird here. The Portuguese
word is <i>açores</i>, with a mark like a comma under the <i>c</i>,
which makes it sound like an <i>s</i>. They have also been
called the Flamingos, or Flemish, the latter being the
Portuguese for the former. They were so called from
the people of Flanders who settled here.</p>

<p>“It is a little odd that these islands, like those
we have lately visited, were discovered by navigators
who were driven off their course by heavy weather.
In this instance it was one J. Vanderberg, a merchant
of the city of Bruges, making a voyage to Lisbon, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span>
had the unfortunate good fortune to discover these
islands in the year 1431. When Vanderberg finally
reached Lisbon, he was imprudent enough to mention
his discovery. At this time Portugal was at the height
of the wonderful prosperity I have before described to
you; and she was ambitious to acquire all the territory
she could. An expedition was immediately fitted out,
which first visited the Formigas, near St. Mary, which
we saw yesterday morning. In due time the Portuguese
obtained full possession of all the islands of the
group; and have held it to the present time. The revolutions
of the mother country have extended to these
islands; and it is said that the women displayed more
of the spirit of resistance than the men in some of
them.</p>

<p>“These islands lie between thirty-six and forty,
north latitude, and twenty-five and thirty-two, west
longitude. They are a province of the kingdom of
Portugal, and are represented in the general Cortes,
Madeira and the Azores having five deputies. The
islands are subdivided into three districts,—the eastern,
western, and central,—according to location. You
observe that the islands are considerably scattered, and
it takes more than a day’s sail for a fast steamer to go
from one extremity of the group to the other.</p>

<p>“Corvo and Flores form the western district. The
latter is the larger island, about ten miles by seven;
and the other is about half its size. They are of volcanic
origin, like all the group; and are mountainous,
some of the peaks being about three thousand feet high.
Santa Cruz is the chief town of Flores: it is seldom
visited by ships, except whalers, which obtain supplies
there cheaper than at the other islands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span>“The central district is composed of five islands, of
which Fayal and Pico are the principal. It is three
and a quarter miles across the channel between them
at the narrowest place. Fayal takes its name from
<i>faya</i>, a beech-tree, and is about a dozen miles in diameter.
Of its population of thirty thousand, one-third
are here in Horta, and the rest in nine villages in the
interior. This place is the capital, and it has the best
harbor in the island; but it is exposed to winds from
the north and north-east, and from the south-east to the
south-west. The south-east gales are the worst ones,
and they rake the anchorage so that it sometimes
becomes necessary for ships to put to sea to keep out
of danger.</p>

<p>“Of course you have noticed the high mountain to
the south-east of us; it is the peak of Pico, from which
the island takes its name. This island is twenty-five
miles long, and from two to nine miles wide. It is
covered with extinct volcanoes. The sugar-loaf peak
of Pico is over seven thousand feet high. The kind
of clouds which gather around the mountain indicate
the coming weather, so that it is a barometer to those
who have the skill to read the signs. The island contains
a large population. By the Statesman’s Year
Book, I find that the area of these islands is a little
less than a thousand square miles, and the population
about two hundred and fifty thousand. The grape
disease, of which I have spoken before, extended to
the Western Islands; and since that time the wine-trade
has been very small. The principal production
is oranges. The wine from this island was called Pico-Madeira;
and it is still manufactured to some extent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[312]</span>“St. George is thirty miles long, and five wide; and
has a peak four thousand feet high in the centre.
Griciosa is about seven miles in diameter, and noted
for its fertility, producing all kinds of grain in abundance.
Terceira was so called because it was the third
island discovered by the Portuguese, the word being
the feminine of the ordinal ‘third.’ It is about twenty
miles in diameter, and exceedingly fertile. It has been
called the principal island of the group. Angra was
formerly the capital of the islands, and is a larger place
than Horta, containing over ten thousand inhabitants,
which is a quarter of the population of the island. Its
harbor is sheltered from the west by the promontory of
Monte Brazil, over five hundred feet high. It is one
of the finest of the Atlantic cities.</p>

<p>“Sao Miguel, or St. Michael, is the largest and most
populous of the Azores. Its length is variously given
from thirty-five to fifty miles and from five to twelve
miles wide. Like the other islands, it is full of volcanoes,
and is remarkable for some curious changes in its
surface; as a grassy plain, covered with trees and foliage,
was raised two thousand feet by volcanic action in
a year. Old craters become lakes; and I hope you
will see an example of this kind here in Fayal. In
1811 an island rose out of the sea, less than two miles
from the shore, and the English took possession of it;
but when they came to look for their new territory, a
few weeks later, it ‘had gone down to drink,’—had
disappeared in the ocean.</p>

<p>“Ponta Delgada is considered the third city of the
Portuguese Dominion, and is on the south side of this
island; its population has been estimated as high as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[313]</span>
fifty thousand. It looks like most of the Portuguese
cities you have seen. The island is very productive,
making a large commerce for this city, which is its principal
port.</p>

<p>“One of the principal industries of Fayal is basket-making;
and stores for the sale of these wares are to
be found in Boston and New York. Lace and fine
needle-work are also specialties, for the wages of
working-women are only a fourth of what they are in
the United States. One hundred and fifty dollars a
year will support a Portuguese family, but not an American.
These islands are very much resorted to by people
from our own country who are troubled with pulmonary
complaints, though the climate is hardly so
free from changes as that of Madeira, and certainly
not as Orotava, in the Canaries. Some of us have
seen the bark Kate Williams coming out of Boston
Harbor, with her deck crowded with passengers for
these islands; and one or two other vessels ply between
the same city and Fayal.”</p>

<p>The professor finished his talk; and the next morning
a boat expedition was organized, in which all the
cutters and barges of the fleet took part. Wainwright
and Scott, by changing with a couple of officers in the
captain’s gig of the Prince, obtained places in the same
boat with Dr. Winstock, Sheridan, and Murray. The
view from the anchorage was magnificent, covering an
expanse of green hill-sides and of burnt and blackened
mountains, the highest in sight being the peak of Pico.</p>

<p>“Can you tell me where the Praca Constitution is,
doctor?” asked Scott, as he gazed at the pretty white
houses of the town.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[314]</span>“I think there was no square of that name when I
was here before; but very likely they have one by this
time,” replied the surgeon, laughing. “Of course a
Spanish or Portuguese town cannot get along without
one. On our right is the castle of Santa Cruz; and
this name is quite as indispensable as that of the Constitution.
Next to it is the mole, where you will land
when you go on shore. The hills, which look so steep
and rugged in places, are about five hundred feet
high.”</p>

<p>“Here is a steep one on the starboard,” added Murray.</p>

<p>“That is only half the height I named. It is Monte
Queimada, a volcano. Its sides look like a mass of
cinders; but the streets and roads of this vicinity are
of the same thing, as are many of the sides of the hills.
Now we are approaching Monte da Guia. It is nearly
five hundred feet high. That building on this side is
a chapel.”</p>

<p>The boats pulled around the point, and soon came
to an opening in the cliffs, not more than an eighth of
a mile wide, into which the Prince’s gig, leading the
way, entered, and proceeded about a quarter of a mile.</p>

<p>“Now we are in the crater of a dead volcano,” said
the doctor, after the oarsmen had been directed to lie
on their oars. “The inside of it has been blown out by
the commotion of the elements, and one side of it has
caved in so as to form a passage into it. You can see
clearly the form of the crater on the land side. We
call these extinct volcanoes; but they are liable to
break out anew at any time. Nine years ago the earth
was fearfully shaken by internal commotions, so that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[315]</span>
the people left their houses, under whose falling walls
they were in danger of being buried, and lodged in tents.
But the ground may open and draw them in at any
time.”</p>

<p>The students gazed with wondering interest at the
interior of the crater. The fleet of boats then pulled
out and around the Point into Pim Bay, an enclosure
formed by the peninsula at the end of which is the
Caldeira Inferno, as the burnt-out volcano is called,
meaning “the caldron of hell,” a name to which it is
properly entitled. Pim Bay is only a quarter of a mile
wide; but it is perfectly sheltered by the high hills
mentioned, and the island, on three sides, but is open
on the south-west. It has a castle for its defence;
and the streets of the town of Horta extend over to it,
so that the port is used for loading small vessels.</p>

<p>The boats returned by noon, and the students were
well pleased with the excursion; but most of them
were anxious to get out into the country, where the
orange-trees were in their glory. After dinner they
were permitted to land, and visit the town, or roam on
the hill-sides, as they chose.</p>

<p>“Nearly two hundred whale-ships used to come into
this port for supplies, and to unload their oil, which
was shipped from here to the United States,” said Dr.
Winstock, when the party had landed at the mole.
“A great many of the people of these islands have
engaged in the whale-fishery in our ships, which has
induced them to emigrate to our country; and there
is a part of New Bedford called ‘New Fayal.’”</p>

<p>“I think I should emigrate if the ground was liable
to open and swallow me up,” said Scott.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[316]</span>“The people are used to that sort of thing,” added
Murray.</p>

<p>“Used to being swallowed up in the earth!” exclaimed
Scott. “I believe it would take me a long time
to get used to that sort of thing; for I am inclined to
think it hurts.”</p>

<p>“Used to the liability, I mean,” protested Murray.</p>

<p>“That is certainly the case,” said the doctor. “One
does not heed danger after he gets used to it. There
are thousands of people who would not risk themselves
on the ocean, as you do every day of your lives without
thinking any thing of it at all.”</p>

<p>The party walked all over the town without seeing
any thing that particularly attracted their attention, or
that was worth recording. The next day they went to
the Caldron, which is an extinct volcano. The crater
is five miles around, the sides sloping uniformly down
to the depth of seventeen hundred feet, and being covered
with grass and foliage of plants. At the bottom
is a lake with a small island in the middle of it. This
island is a hill having a hole in the top of it, from
which the subterranean fires once poured out.</p>

<p>Another day was given to an excursion over to Pico;
and then the regular work of the schoolroom was resumed.
The squadron remained a week at the port of
Horta, wondering why the Ville d’Angers did not come.</p>

<p>“I am afraid my ward has given you the slip altogether,”
said Judge Rodwood, when all hands were out
of patience at the non-arrival of the steamer.</p>

<p>“I do not think so now; though I had some painful
suspicions to that effect in the first of it,” replied Mr.
Lowington.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[317]</span>“Capt. O’Hara has certainly had time enough to get
here,” added the judge. “It is not more than a three-days’
run from Teneriffe to these islands.”</p>

<p>“Unless the Ville d’Angers returned to Funchal,
Capt. O’Hara would not know where to look for the
squadron,” argued the principal. “I have no doubt
the students are safe enough, and that they will join
us some time.”</p>

<p>“There may have been a row on board,” suggested
Dr. Phelps. “You remember the captain had some
trouble with his crew, according to the English paper
which gave us the news.”</p>

<p>“I do not apprehend any thing serious on that account;
for the boatswain and the carpenter will obey
the orders of the captain, whatever happens; and he
has the means to conquer any rebellion with their
help.”</p>

<p>“But we have heard nothing from them since the
newspaper account, except that they had sailed for
Funchal, and then from Funchal for the Canaries,” continued
the judge. “Are we to wait here till they
come?”</p>

<p>“It is a run of nearly eighteen hundred miles to the
Bermudas, which is our next stopping-place; and I
should like to see the Ville d’Angers before she sets out
on this long voyage,” replied Mr. Lowington. “I have
my doubts whether Mr. Frisbone, as he has the invalid
sister of his wife with him, will care to go any farther
than Madeira; and I depend upon him to assist in
keeping things straight on board of the steamer.”</p>

<p>Another day passed, and the Ville d’Angers came
not. Mr. Lowington began to be anxious, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[318]</span>
judge was more impatient than ever. At last, after a
long conference, it was decided that the two steamers
of the fleet should return to the Madeiras in search of
the truants. Before night they were on their way; but
they were not ten hours out of Horta when the fog
settled down upon them, and they were buried in it till
they were near their destination. They went into the
harbor of Funchal; but the Ville d’Angers had not
returned.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIII.<br>

<small>CARRYING OUT THE PROGRAMME.</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">CAPT. O’HARA went on shore as soon as the
Ville d’Angers dropped her anchor in the harbor
of Funchal. After considerable inquiry he found the
agent of the principal, and was very much surprised to
learn that the fleet had sailed for the Canary Islands,
leaving no instructions for him. The agent, or banker,
knew nothing whatever of the intentions of Mr. Lowington,
nor even where the academy squadron was
going from the Canaries.</p>

<p>When the fleet sailed from Funchal, Mr. Lowington
and the vice-principals had no doubt whatever that the
absent students would return to the Madeiras by the
mail-steamer which would arrive the last of the month.
For this reason the principal had not thought to leave
any instructions for O’Hara. They were all confident
they should find the party domiciled at a hotel on their
arrival from the Canaries, or on board of the packet,
if the fleet arrived before her. The problem was simple
enough; and there appeared to be no chance for a
failure to connect.</p>

<p>O’Hara was on shore a couple of hours in his search
for the banker, and in looking up what information he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[320]</span>
could obtain in regard to the fleet. As soon as the
island of Porto Santo was seen from the fore-top of the
steamer, Gregory and Clinch began to be very nervous
about the prospect ahead. They feared that the
Josephine was still at Funchal, in spite of Gregory’s
theory to the contrary. Whatever disposition was
made of the rest of the ship’s company of the steamer,
they were sure they should be handed over to the
senior vice-principal on board of the schooner. They
would at once be sent into the steerage of the vessel;
and this they regarded as the worst fate that could possibly
befall them.</p>

<p>Since they had the liberty of the steamer, they had
been planning all sorts of wild expeditions with the
“sprigs,” who had the highest opinion of the enterprise
of Gregory. They did not care for Clinch; but
they would rather take him than lose his companion
in rebellion. They all desired to see the island of
Madeira; and they were willing to stay there a month
or more in the springtime. After this, though their
plans were not yet clearly defined, they intended to
visit other islands of the Atlantic, and then go to the
United States. Gregory was at home there, and would
be of service to them.</p>

<p>“All this is very nice,” said Gregory, after the land
had been reported; “but it will be all up with me as
soon as we get to Funchal. I shall be sent on board
of the vessel to which I belong; and that will be the
last you will see of me.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” exclaimed his British cousin. “We
are to get you out of this in some way.”</p>

<p>“How are you to get me out of it? That’s the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[321]</span>
question,” replied Gregory. “It is not so easy a thing
as you seem to imagine.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know just how: I had not considered that.
We can’t very well make the plan till we see the situation.”</p>

<p>“There is no situation about it, Phil. After the
vessel comes to anchor, I shall be sent on board of the
Josephine, and that will be the end of it.”</p>

<p>“Don’t croak, Dave!” protested Sir Philip, with
some impatience in his manner. “The health officer
will have to see you and Clinch when he visits the ship,
just as they do in those bloody ports up the Mediterranean,
where I spent my last vacation. After that,
we can fix things all right.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe you can,” added Gregory dubiously.
“If we wait till that time, it will be all up with me.”</p>

<p>“Not at all! I will tell you just how I will do it
now, for I am beginning to get an idea,” continued the
Briton. “You are about my size, and don’t look very
unlike me. I shall pretend I have an ague, or a cold
in the head, or something of that kind. After I have
said good-by to the ladies and others, I will conceal
myself in some part of the vessel. Then you will put
on my mackintosh, cap, and muffler. You will cover
your face, so that they will not know it is not I, and
get into the boat, which we will have at the steps of
the gangway beforehand. It shall be a shore-boat,
and no one will know any thing about the little trick.”</p>

<p>Sir Philip Grayner rubbed his hands as though he
was delighted with the ingenuity of the plan he had
devised, and he thought it was very “clever.”</p>

<p>“What will you do?” asked Gregory, who thought
the plan might work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[322]</span>“When you have had time to put yourself into a safe
place, I will show myself. Of course they will be surprised
to see me; and I shall be obliged to confess
that I have played a bit of a Yankee trick upon them.”</p>

<p>“Then they will know I have gone.”</p>

<p>“No matter if they do, after you are secure on shore.
But very likely they will find that you have gone before
I show myself. I can get the boatman to come back
to the ship after he has landed you, and then I can say
that I have come on board again after something I had
left in my state-room; and I can leave something
there to make it seem all right. Of course you will
take all my luggage with you when you go on shore.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps that will all work very well, so far as I
am concerned; but how about Clinch?” asked Gregory.</p>

<p>“Oh, bother about Clinch!” exclaimed the Briton.
“We don’t want him any way. He will spoil the whole
thing; and this will be a good plan to get rid of him.”</p>

<p>“But he has stood by me in all this business; and I
can’t desert him,” answered Gregory. “It would be
mean for me to do that.”</p>

<p>“But Lord Fillgrove must go in the boat with you,
and come back with the boatman. It won’t look regular
if he don’t,” protested Sir Philip. “I don’t see
any way to get Clinch out of the steamer, unless we
get him into the boat in some manner before you and
Fillgrove get in. You can manage that better than I
can; for you know the rules of your bloody ships, and
I do not.”</p>

<p>“Shakings overlooks every boat that comes to the
steamer, or leaves it. We couldn’t get Clinch into the
boat any more than we could get the engine into it,”
replied Gregory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[323]</span>“Then you must leave him on board, unless you are
willing to give up the journeys we have planned.”</p>

<p>“I am not willing to give them up, or to give up
Clinch.”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what we can do. Tell Clinch I have
a scheme by which I shall get him out of the ship
after you and Fillgrove have gone,” suggested the
Briton.</p>

<p>“What is the scheme?” demanded Gregory.</p>

<p>“I haven’t it ready yet; but I will think of it.”</p>

<p>“Then it’s only to get rid of him; and I will not
consent to that,” protested Gregory. But, if he had
been entirely candid, he would have admitted that he
did not care so much for Clinch’s company as he had
before, now that he had better associates,—a baronet
and a viscount.</p>

<p>“I don’t mean to get rid of your friend, though I
don’t care for him. There are a dozen means of getting
him out of the ship; and I shall fix upon one
before we reach the harbor,” replied Sir Philip. “I
see it now! When you get on shore, you can get some
young fellow, dressed in poor clothes, to come on board
with Fillgrove; and Clinch shall change his uniform
for that of the stranger, and go on shore in his place.
That will work like a charm!”</p>

<p>The Briton was entirely satisfied with the scheme;
and Gregory was rather pleased with it, though he was
not so sanguine of its success as his cousin. He had
a talk with Clinch on the subject; and that worthy was
willing to assent to any thing that promised to release
him from his captivity, and save him from the degradation
of being sent into the steerage of the Josephine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[324]</span>It was about noon when the Ville d’Angers dropped
her anchor off the Loo Rock. The health officers
promptly presented themselves; and all hands were
obliged to show themselves on the rail of the vessel,
to assure the official that the persons named in the
papers were well and hearty. As soon as this formality
had been complied with, the captain ordered out his
boat to go on shore; for all the surprise and consternation
at not finding the academy squadron in the harbor
had been expressed before the steamer anchored.</p>

<p>Plenty of shore-boats were within hailing distance of
the gangway; and Gregory, as had been arranged,
“went into retirement.” The mackintosh, cap, and
other articles belonging to Sir Philip had been placed
where they would be available as soon as the mutineer
needed his disguise. Capt. Fairfield was conducting
his recitations in the after-part of the cabin; and the
exercises were not interrupted by the arrival of the
vessel in port, as the watch on deck was sufficient to
anchor the steamer. As soon as the health examination
was finished, the recitations were resumed. The
mutineers had not been asked to attend to their studies,
for the reason that it would bring them into too close
relations with the members of the starboard watch.</p>

<p>“But the academy vessels are not here!” exclaimed
Sir Philip, seeking Gregory in his retirement.</p>

<p>“So much the better!” ejaculated the malecontent.</p>

<p>“But what will the captain of the steamer do? he
was confident of finding all the squadron here,” added
the Briton.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what he will do; and he is not likely
to take me into his confidence,” said Gregory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[325]</span>“The captain has gone on shore; and I dare say he
will do as Prince Frisbone advises him to do.”</p>

<p>“I suppose he will.”</p>

<p>“Then we will wait till the captain returns before we
do any thing,” continued Sir Philip.</p>

<p>“Don’t do that!” exclaimed Gregory, appalled at
the suggestion. “What do you want to wait for?”</p>

<p>“As the squadron isn’t here, very likely this steamer
will go on to some other place.”</p>

<p>“Let it go! I don’t care whither it goes if I can
only get out of it!” exclaimed Gregory.</p>

<p>“But I rather like this sort of life. I have had a
jolly good time since I came on board of the Ville
d’Angers; and I am in no hurry to leave her if she is
going farther, and the captain, or rather Prince Frisbone,
will allow me to do so.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to go any farther in her!” protested
Gregory, disgusted with the proposition of his cousin.
“I am a prisoner on board of this vessel; and, if you
intend to remain any longer in her, I shall get out of
her before she leaves Funchal if I can. That’s the
kind of a codfish I am.”</p>

<p>“But if the Josephine isn’t here, they can’t send you
back to her, you know,” added the sprig.</p>

<p>“That’s very true; but if she had been here, the
captain wouldn’t have gone on shore, and they would
have bundled me on board of her before this time,”
growled Gregory, utterly dissatisfied with the present
situation of his affairs. “Don’t you see that I can get
off twice as well now that the captain and his boat’s
crew have left the ship?”</p>

<p>“Upon my word, I believe you are more than half
right, Dave!” exclaimed the Briton.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[326]</span>“Your plan wouldn’t have worked at all, if the fleet
had been in the harbor. Don’t you see that Fluxion
would have been alongside the steamer as soon as the
health officer would let him do so? He would miss me
at once, for I am one of his officers, and would ask for
me. That would bring out the captain’s story, and I
should be looked up at once. We are in luck as it is;
and I am in favor of attending to the business at this
very moment, and before the captain gets back.”</p>

<p>“All right! and to oblige you, Dave, I will give up
the idea of making a longer cruise in the Ville d’Angers,”
replied Sir Philip. “I will go on deck, and hail
a boat.”</p>

<p>He had hardly gone before Clinch joined Gregory.
They had a conference in regard to Clinch’s prospect
of getting off if his companion succeeded; and Gregory
assured him he was almost sure that the plan relating
to his friend would work even better than the one
for his own escape. Clinch was satisfied with this
answer, and was confident that his companion would
stand by him.</p>

<p>On deck Sir Philip found only Speers, the second
officer, and four seamen. Capt. O’Hara had taken
Raymond with him for the reason that the latter could
speak the Portuguese language. The engineers were
all busy with the machinery. Speers was studying his
lessons in the pilot-house, as he did every moment of
the time when he was not on duty. O’Hara, as has
been stated before, had spoken of a new method of
making the promotions, which had come to his knowledge.
The captain and the other officers of the
steamer were intensely interested in this information,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[327]</span>
and they wished to be prepared for it, whatever it
proved to be; for they had no knowledge of the nature
of the new method.</p>

<p>O’Hara and Speers had been studying with all their
might, in order to be ready for any thing. What the
new method was, the students had the privilege of
guessing; and they could not well help using it. The
captain thought it must be a new system of marking
the value of the students’ work; but the second officer
felt very confident that the promotions were to be made
by the results of a monthly examination. Each argued
for his own view, and each continued to struggle to put
himself in condition for any thing.</p>

<p>Sir Philip and Lord Fillgrove ventured to interrupt
the studies of the officer of the deck long enough to
say good-by to him. Tom shook hands with them,
responding to their expressions of good-will, and then
resumed his study; for he was in the middle of a difficult
problem in navigation, and he did not wish to lose
the run of it.</p>

<p>The two sprigs bade farewell to the Prince and the
ladies, who were making their preparations to go on
shore. They took leave of Capt. Fairfield and the
officers of the starboard watch in a body, and then
hastened out of the cabin. Calling a boat to the
gangway, the steward put their luggage into it; and
then Sir Philip hastened below to carry out the more
difficult part of the programme. All things worked
perfectly, and he did not find it necessary at present to
act the farce of being sick or having the ague. The
day was quite cool; and this was a good reason for
putting on an overcoat, especially as there was considerable
sea in the harbor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[328]</span>“Now we are all ready!” exclaimed the Baronet, in
a low tone, as he joined his cousin in the smoking-room,
an apartment which had been used during the
voyage only by the Britons.</p>

<p>“Who’s on deck?” asked Gregory very nervously.</p>

<p>“Mr. Speers is in the pilot-house studying his navigation;
and there are some seamen about the deck;
but all is working well. I have the luggage in the
boat, and Fillgrove has put on his ulster so as to be in
keeping with you. Here is the mackintosh, Dave; on
with it,” continued Sir Philip, taking the coat from the
peg where he had hung it.</p>

<p>Gregory put on the garment, and put the muffler
around his neck, concealing his face below the nose.
Sir Philip jammed his Scotch cap down over his eyes,
and it would have been difficult for any one to discover
the deception. No one on board would have suspected
that the coat did not contain a young baronet.</p>

<p>“Now, here is a sovereign to blind the eyes of the
steward if he looks too closely at you,” continued the
Briton, as he opened the door of the smoking-room.
“Don’t stop a moment till you are in the boat.”</p>

<p>Gregory left the room, and hastened to the gangway,
where the steward, who had waited on the sprigs at the
table, stood by the side of the other passenger.</p>

<p>“You will be warm enough in that coat and those
mufflers,” said the steward, as Gregory approached the
steps.</p>

<p>“This blasted water is very rough and cold,” interposed
Lord Fillgrove, turning up the collar of his
ulster. “It is best to keep the bloody stuff outside of
you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[329]</span>“So it is, my lord,” replied the man.</p>

<p>At this moment Gregory handed the steward the
money the baronet had given him for the purpose,
though his companion had distracted the attention of
the man.</p>

<p>“God bless you, Sir Philip!” exclaimed the grateful
steward, as he put the sovereign in his pocket; and no
doubt he wished the steamer had more passengers of
the same sort, for his lordship had “tipped” him in
the same amount.</p>

<p>Gregory hurried down the steps into the boat, and
seated himself in the stern-sheets. The Portuguese
boatman pushed off, and in a moment more was pulling
his fare to the shore.</p>

<p>“This won’t do!” exclaimed Gregory, when the boat
had gone but a short distance.</p>

<p>“What won’t do?” asked Lord Fillgrove.</p>

<p>“The boatman is headed towards the usual landing-place;
and the captain’s boat is there, waiting for him.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see that we can help ourselves,” replied his
lordship.</p>

<p>“Tell the fellow to pull us to some other place!”
persisted Gregory, in mortal terror lest Raymond
should discover him when he went on shore.</p>

<p>“But you can’t land anywhere else; the custom-house
blackguards will have to overhaul the luggage,
don’t you know?”</p>

<p>There was no help for it, and Gregory had to submit
to the course of events. But Lord Fillgrove volunteered
to do all the talking, and suggested that his
companion should pretend to have the toothache, or
the ague, or something of that sort. The boat carried<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[330]</span>
them to the usual landing-place; and the boatman
handed the baggage out upon the mole. The custom-house
officers were very indulgent, and did not detain
them beyond a few moments.</p>

<p>The captain’s boat was lying near the shore, and
Raymond sat in the stern-sheets. He could not help
seeing the passengers; and his lordship waved his
adieus; but the fourth officer of the Ville d’Angers
did not seem to be satisfied with this parting, and
ordered the bowman to pull the boat in to the shore.
The officer landed, and seized the hand of Lord Fillgrove.</p>

<p>“I am sorry you are going to leave us,” said he.</p>

<p>“And Sir Philip and I have shed tears at the necessity
of saying good-by to you,” gushed his lordship.</p>

<p>“But what is the matter with Sir Philip?” asked
Raymond, wondering that he was so distant and unsocial,
when they had been on excellent terms on board
of the steamer.</p>

<p>“You must excuse Sir Philip, for he is in terrible
agony with a toothache which has just seized him. He
is in such pain, that he can’t open his mouth,” replied
Lord Fillgrove.</p>

<p>With one hand on his jaw, Gregory extended the
other to Raymond, who warmly pressed it.</p>

<p>“I am sorry you are in such pain, Sir Philip; but I
know what the toothache is, and I will not detain you
a moment,” added Raymond, shaking the hand he held
again.</p>

<p>Gregory hastened away, holding on to his jaw, and
groaning audibly to heighten the deception; and, though
Raymond had the credit of being a sharp officer, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[331]</span>
did not suspect any thing wrong about the passengers.
His lordship called a porter (or, rather, he selected
one from a dozen who had called themselves), and
directed the luggage to be carried to the principal
hotel. In a few moments he overtook his companion,
who had turned down the collar of his mackintosh, for
he had suddenly recovered from his toothache, and
seemed to be in good spirits for one who had been
such a recent sufferer.</p>

<p>“That was cleverly done,” chuckled his lordship, as
they followed the porter to the hotel.</p>

<p>“Nothing could have been better done; no Yankee
could have managed it more neatly,” replied Gregory.</p>

<p>“No, I should say not! If that was a Yankee trick,
we Britishers can play a good game at it,” said Lord
Fillgrove, laughing.</p>

<p>A short walk brought them to the hotel, and they
were assigned a room. As soon as the baggage had
been brought in, they locked the door.</p>

<p>“Now what am I to do?” asked Gregory. “I am
sure to be bagged if I stay here. As soon as I am
missed, O’Hara will be after me with a sharp stick; or,
more likely, he will send that bear of a Prince Frisbone
to look me up.”</p>

<p>“You mustn’t stay in the town an hour!” exclaimed
his lordship. “Have you any money to pay your
expenses?”</p>

<p>“I have plenty of sovereigns,” answered Gregory.</p>

<p>“Those are the best money to have anywhere on
Portuguese territory. Find a horse, and ride till you
come to some town or village; and don’t let the grass
grow under your feet.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[332]</span>A couple of ponies were soon found, and a guide was
engaged who spoke English. Thus prepared, Gregory
hastened off. Lord Fillgrove returned to the mole,
where he obtained a boat, and was pulled off to the
ship. He had picked up a porter on his way, and had
already given a liberal fee to both him and the boatman.
He saw that the captain’s boat was still lying
at the mole; but he gave it a wide berth this time, for
he had no “blackguards of custom-house officers” to
bother him. His lordship had brought back the mackintosh
and other clothing of his fellow-passenger. Sir
Philip put them on. He had Clinch in the smoking-room
with him, and in a few moments the porter and
the mutineer had exchanged garments. Sir Philip
brought a carpet-bag he had left in his state-room, and
Clinch was required to carry it to the gangway.</p>

<p>For some reason or other, Speers was on the poop-deck.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIV.<br>

<small>A HASTY RUN TO THE CAPE VERDS.</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">POSSIBLY Tom Speers had finished his difficult
problem in navigation, and was making his rounds
of the deck of the ship; or possibly the coming of the
shore-boat had been reported to him by the lookout,
and he wished to assure himself that every thing about
the steamer was all right: at any rate, the officer of
the deck was there, just where the sprigs did not wish
him to be.</p>

<p>“Ah, Sir Philip, I thought you had gone on shore
some time ago,” said Tom, as blandly as though there
was no mischief in him.</p>

<p>“So I did go on shore, Mr. Speers; but I forgot
this bloody carpet-bag, and I came back after it,” replied
the baronet, pointing to the piece of baggage in
the hand of the assumed porter.</p>

<p>Speers looked at the bag, and then into the face of
the porter, though Clinch turned away, and tried to
avoid his gaze.</p>

<p>“Really, Mr. Clinch, I don’t think you look so well
in that dress as you do in your regular uniform,” said
Speers, with a pleasant smile.</p>

<p>At the same time he placed himself between the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[334]</span>
intended fugitive and the gangway. He looked as mild
as one of the chaplain’s lambs; and the Britons evidently
did not regard his opposition as very serious.</p>

<p>“I will thank you to step out of the way, Mr. Speers,
and allow his lordship and myself to get into the boat,”
said Sir Philip, rather brusquely.</p>

<p>“Certainly, Sir Philip; I have not the slightest
objection to your getting into the boat,” replied Tom,
stepping aside so that the baronet could pass, but still
remaining between Clinch and the steps.</p>

<p>“And that porter must carry my bag into the boat,
and take it up to the hotel when he gets ashore,” continued
Sir Philip haughtily.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, Sir Philip; but the captain’s
order is, that no one belonging to the steamer shall be
allowed to go on shore,” interposed the officer of the
deck.</p>

<p>“Into the boat with you, porter!” cried the baronet,
who was disposed to carry his point, though he was
entirely willing to part company with Clinch, whom he
regarded as an undesirable companion for the proposed
lark.</p>

<p>Clinch saw that his last chance was to make a rush
into the boat, in which Lord Fillgrove had already
seated himself. He made a desperate push to get by
Tom Speers; but the officer promptly grabbed him by
the collar, and crowded him back from the rail.</p>

<p>“Let go of him, or I’ll break your bloody head!”
exclaimed Sir Philip.</p>

<p>“I should be sorry to strike a baronet; but, if you
do, there will be two bloody and broken heads in this
vicinity,” answered Tom quietly. “Mr. Clinch is an
officer of the steamer, and he cannot leave her.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[335]</span>“But he shall leave her!” protested Sir Philip, blustering
up to the officer of the deck.</p>

<p>“I think not.—Winchell, pass the word for Mr.
Shakings,” added Tom, addressing one of the watch
who had come up to see what the matter was.</p>

<p>“Pass the word for Mr. Shakings!” called Winchell,
hailing the other seamen of the watch on the forecastle.</p>

<p>“Now’s your time, Clinch!” shouted Sir Philip.
“Into the boat with you before the big boatswain
comes!”</p>

<p>Clinch threw the carpet-bag upon the rail, and rushed
upon Speers, intent upon crowding him out of the way.
But Tom was stout, resolute, and self-possessed; and
he easily flung his adversary back. But the Briton on
the deck was excited; and he went in to assist the
porter. He struck Speers a heavy blow in the face,
while he was engaged with Clinch; but, as soon as the
mutineer was disposed of, Tom turned his attention to
the sprig; and, with a well-directed hit on the nose,
sent him over backwards, with his prominent facial
organ bathed in gore. The victory was certainly with
Tom Speers so far. But Clinch had picked himself up
during this diversion, and was about to leap on the
rail, when Shakings grabbed him by the collar.</p>

<p>“So you have got a new uniform, my beauty!” exclaimed
the big boatswain, as he slung his prisoner
back like a basket of bread.</p>

<p>Sir Philip picked himself up; and he was the maddest
baronet on the face of the Western Continent.
He wanted to fight for revenge now rather than for
the possession of Clinch. He was making a rush at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[336]</span>
Tom Speers, who stood ready for him, when Mr. Rimmer,
attracted by the scuffle, came aft as fast as his
slow-moulded nature would permit.</p>

<p>“Hold this fellow, Rimmer,” said Shakings, handing
Clinch over to him. “I never whacked a baronet yet;
but now is my chance!”</p>

<p>Speers had warded off the blow of Sir Philip, and
put his left eye in mourning, when the big boatswain
seized the baronet by the collar, and tipped him over
upon the deck. The sprig struggled with all his might;
and the boatswain kept flopping him over and over on
the planks, as one deals with an unruly fish he has
pulled out of the water. In a few moments the baronet
had had enough of this harsh treatment, and he
refrained from further struggles.</p>

<p>“Shall I lock him up in a state-room, Mr. Speers?”
asked Shakings, as he held his prisoner at arm’s length.</p>

<p>“Lock me up in a state-room!” exclaimed Sir Philip,
gasping for breath, after his violent struggle. “I am a
British subject!”</p>

<p>“But British subjects must behave themselves on
board of this vessel, as well as others,” replied Shakings,
laughing at the bluster of the baronet.</p>

<p>“Hallo! what’s all this about?” called the Prince,
coming out of the cabin, where he had been disturbed
by the noise of the struggle.</p>

<p>Tom Speers pointed to Clinch, in his Portuguese
dress, and explained the cause of the trouble.</p>

<p>“You haven’t behaved yourself as a barinet should,”
said the Prince. “If you want to interfere with the
discipline of this vessel, you won’t feel at home here.—What
do you wish to do with him, Mr. Speers?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[337]</span>“I don’t wish to do any thing with him; and I haven’t
objected to his getting into the boat,” replied Speers.
“He pitched into me because I would not let Clinch
leave the vessel; and I have simply defended myself,
though it has cost him a black eye and a bloody nose.
Put him into his boat, Mr. Shakings.”</p>

<p>The baronet wiped his bleeding member; and, while
he was doing so, Shakings hoisted him upon the rail,
and gave him a smart shove down the steps. Sir Philip
saw that he was making nothing by prolonging the
conflict; and now, if not before, he realized that he was
fighting for one whom he desired to get rid of. He
had done all he could to gratify his cousin’s sense of
honor, and he went down into the boat. The boatman
shoved off, and pulled for the shore.</p>

<p>“Where is Mr. Gregory?” asked Speers, when the
boat had gone; for he thought it a little strange that
the other mutineer was not in the scrape.</p>

<p>Search for Gregory was made; and of course nothing
was found of him, for at this time he was galloping
away from Funchal. But in the smoking-room, the
Portuguese porter was found, dressed up in Clinch’s
uniform. Shakings could not help laughing at the figure
the swarthy fellow cut in his blue frock, or at the
appearance of Clinch in the garments of the Portuguese.
Speers ordered them to exchange garments; and directed
the boatswain to lock the officer into his state-room
till the captain returned.</p>

<p>It was evident that Gregory had escaped from the
steamer; and, by comparing notes, it was made plain
enough that he had gone off in the mackintosh and cap
of the baronet. The officer of the deck called a shore-boat,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[338]</span>
and sent one of the stewards with a note for the
captain to the mole where Raymond was waiting for
him. It contained a brief account of what had happened
on board during his absence.</p>

<p>O’Hara was very unwilling to leave the harbor without
the fugitive; and he stated his case to the consul,
who promised to have him arrested as a runaway sailor.</p>

<p>O’Hara had only ascertained that the squadron had
sailed for Santa Cruz de Teneriffe six days before.
He had no doubt the fleet was there then; and he examined
the chart. Satisfied with the promise of the
consul to arrest and hold the escaped prisoner, he
decided, after consulting the adults on board, to sail
for the Canaries. Mr. Frisbone concluded to remain on
board, with his wife and her sister; for they had all
become in a measure accustomed to the sea, and Miss
Louise had wonderfully improved in health.</p>

<p>O’Hara was very confident that he should find the
fleet at Santa Cruz; but great was his astonishment
when he arrived, to find it was not there. He ordered
out the second cutter; and, taking Raymond with him
to talk Spanish for him, he went on shore. He inquired
at the custom-house, and learned that the
squadron, with the Marian, had sailed for Palmas, in
the Grand Canary. As at Funchal, the principal had
kept his own counsel, and no further information could
be obtained. This was the first time he heard that
the steam-yacht of Judge Rodwood was with the squadron.</p>

<p>“Tom, my boy, the judge is after you,” said O’Hara
when he returned to the ship. “He came here with
the squadron, in the Marian; and she seems to be a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[339]</span>
part of the fleet, for she sailed with the other vessels
for the Grand Canary.”</p>

<p>“Then perhaps my cruise in the Tritonia is nearly
up,” replied Tom, rather sadly.</p>

<p>“Faix, I don’t know that we shall ever find that same
fleet!” exclaimed Capt. O’Hara. “It seems to be
dodging us, wherever we go.”</p>

<p>“I am in no great hurry to find it,” added Tom, with
a smile, as he turned to his books, which were his constant
companions when he was not on duty, and sometimes
when he was.</p>

<p>“Well, what’s to be done?” asked the Prince, as
O’Hara reported to him the latest news.</p>

<p>“I suppose we can do nothing but follow the fleet;
and, if it holds still long enough, I have no doubt we
shall find it after a while,” answered O’Hara.</p>

<p>“But I didn’t cal’late to go any further than Me-day-ry.
I am over here now to build up the health of
Louise; and here we are trapsing all over the ocean
with you boys,” added Mr. Frisbone, laughing.</p>

<p>“Upon my sowl, the young lady is growing prettier
and prettier every day she lives!” exclaimed the gallant
captain. “I think you are doing the right thing
now for her health.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know but we are; for sartainly she is
gaining every day; and her appetite is as good as one
of the hands before the mast.”</p>

<p>“I should be sorry to have you leave us, Prince
Frisbone; for you have kept my back as stiff as the
mainmast of the ship,” said O’Hara, who was really
very much attached to the eccentric passenger, as well
as to the ladies of his party.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[340]</span>“I should be sorry to leave before you find the
squadron; but you may chase it clean across the ocean
to America.”</p>

<p>“Then stay with us, darling; for I may be sent in
the steamer to bring you back to whatever port you
want to go,” replied O’Hara, laughing. “Though I
am doing my best to find the fleet, I like the position
I hold now very well indeed; and it will be a sorry
day when I have to give it up.”</p>

<p>“But you ought to see sunthin or other of these
islands we go to; and I know my women-folks would
like to stretch themselves on shore,” added the Prince.</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t dare to stop a day anywhere till I find
the squadron,” said the captain, shaking his head, and
looking very serious.</p>

<p>“But perhaps you are running away from it all the
time,” suggested the Prince.</p>

<p>Capt. Fairfield and Mr. Shakings were called; and
they took the same view as the Prince. The fleet
had gone to the southward; and very likely it would
return in a few days. This consideration induced
O’Hara to decide upon a stay of a couple of days; and
all hands, except Clinch, were allowed to go on shore.
On the 30th of the month, as the fleet did not appear,
the Ville d’Angers sailed for Palmas. She arrived the
same day; and the captain learned that the squadron
had gone to Orotava. After having a look at this city,
Mr. Frisbone decided to take his wife’s sister there in
the fall, and remain all winter.</p>

<p>From this port the fleet had sailed for Santa Cruz
de Palma; and the steamer followed her after spending
a day at Orotava. On her arrival, the captain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[341]</span>
learned that the fleet had departed. As none of the
vessels were commercial craft, it did not appear that
they had entered at the custom-house. As they came
from another port in the Canary Islands, they had
simply anchored, and the students went on shore to see
the town, and what they could of the island, in a few
hours. But where had the fleet gone now? for what
port had it sailed? The custom-house officials knew
nothing about the destination of the squadron. O’Hara
and Raymond wandered about the town in
search of information. Where was the pilot? there
was no harbor to enter, and they had taken no pilot.</p>

<p>“We don’t get ahead any,” said O’Hara, after they
had continued the search for some time.</p>

<p>“Don’t you know what the principal’s programme
for the voyage among the Isles of the Sea is?” inquired
Raymond.</p>

<p>“I don’t know: he never gave me a copy of it.”</p>

<p>“I have heard it said that the squadron was to go
to the Cape Verd Islands after Madeira, and then to the
Azores.”</p>

<p>“I have heard that same,” added O’Hara. “But
don’t Capt. Fairfield know any thing about it?”</p>

<p>As Capt. Fairfield was on shore with the rest of the
ship’s company, he was able to speak for himself. He
confirmed the impression of the captain and the fourth
officer, that the squadron was to go to the Cape Verds.
But he did not believe that it had been definitely
settled where the vessels were to go; and whether or
not they visited certain islands, was to depend upon
circumstances. The West Indies had been given up
on account of the lateness of the season. While Capt.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[342]</span>
O’Hara was talking to the instructor about the matter,
a custom-house official spoke to Raymond.</p>

<p>“I am told that you wish to know for what port the
two steamers and the two schooners that were here
three days ago were bound when they left,” said the
officer.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir: we desire to know very much,” replied
Raymond. “Can you give us any information?”</p>

<p>“I can’t say that I have any official knowledge; but
I heard one of the gentlemen from the smaller steamer
say they were bound for Porto Praya, in the Cape
Verds.”</p>

<p>This intelligence seemed to settle the matter. It
was generally understood among the students, that the
cruise was to include these islands; and the statement
of the custom-house official confirmed it. The officer
spoke with Raymond in Spanish; but if he had heard
him speak English, or try to do so, he would have been
satisfied the islander was not a reliable person to report
an English conversation.</p>

<p>“If we are to follow up the fleet, we may as well go
to Porto Praya,” said O’Hara, when all hands had returned
to the ship after their visit to the town.</p>

<p>“I do not see that we can do any other way,” replied
Tom Speers, to whom the remark was addressed. “If
the fleet has been to these islands, it will not be likely
to come here again.”</p>

<p>“That it will not; and we will sail for the Cape
Verds at once.”</p>

<p>Just before dark the Ville d’Angers went out of the
port, and directed her head to the south-south-west.
Shakings knew all about these islands; for he had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[343]</span>
in a man-of-war on this station, and the port most used
by the African squadron was Porto Praya. The weather
was delightful, and the steamer made a quick run in a
little over three days. The last was spent in sight of
the more eastern of the ten islands forming the group.
Capt. Fairfield encouraged the students to study up the
geography and history of the Cape Verds, in the absence
of Mr. Mapps.</p>

<p>Like some of the other islands they had seen, their
appearance from the ship was that of barren wastes of
rock and lava. Off Porto Praya a pilot was obtained;
for the port has one of the best harbors to be found
among the Isles of the Sea, though a heavy sea sometimes
breaks in on the shore, which renders it almost
impossible to land. It was necessary to coal the
steamer here, and while the work was in progress the
students were allowed to go on shore. They found
much to interest them here, for some things were different
from what they had seen in any of the other
islands. They took a stroll out of the town, and followed
a grassy valley for a couple of miles. Nineteen
out of every twenty persons they met in the town and
in the country were negroes; and they were very lazy
and indolent. They saw plenty of goats, monkeys, and
parrots in their walk when they went out of the travelled
road. Diminutive donkeys were the only domestic
animals. There is scarcely any thing that can be
called a tree, except the baobab-tree, which is only
twelve or fifteen feet high, but is some twenty feet in
diameter, while its thick head of branches is nearly fifty
feet through. The fruit is called “monkey-bread.”
Sugar, cotton, tobacco, rice, and goat-skins are among
the principal productions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[344]</span>Santiago is the largest and most important of these
islands. It is about thirty miles long, and half as wide.
It has a population of ten thousand, the greater part
of which is in Porto Praya. This town is the capital of
the islands; but it is a poorly built place, on a hill.
The students were not disposed to spend much of their
time on shore here. It was a vastly different region
from the sunny Canaries; and they were not sorry to
leave it.</p>

<p>The fleet was not here. Nothing had been heard
from it. It was evident enough, after a full inquiry,
that the squadron had not been to the Cape Verds.
With the bunkers filled with coal, the Ville d’Angers
sailed to the north-west, with the intention of looking
into the coaling-station on the island of St. Vincent.
A run of half a day brought them between this island
and St. Antonio, so that they could look into the bay.
No fleet was there; but the lofty peak of San Antonio,
nearly ten thousand feet high, was to be seen on the
island of this name.</p>

<p>“We shall never find that fleet,” said O’Hara, when
the ship was out in the open sea, but with the lofty
mountain still frowning down upon her.</p>

<p>“I doubt if we ever do,” replied Tom Speers.</p>

<p>“I don’t know where to go next in search of that
same fleet,” continued O’Hara. “I think we must
hold another council of war. Will you oblige me,
Tom, darlint, by asking Prince Frisbone, Capt. Fairfield,
and Mr. Shakings to step into the pilot-house?”</p>

<p>In a few minutes the council had assembled, and
Capt. O’Hara conducted them into the chart-room
adjoining. The large-scale charts, which had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[345]</span>
procured at Funchal and elsewhere, of the Cape Verds,
had been put away; and the “North Atlantic” lay on
the table spread out for use.</p>

<p>“I haven’t the slightest doubt now that the fleet
went from Funchal to the Western Islands,” said Capt.
O’Hara, when the adults had assembled.</p>

<p>“I think we may be sartain of that now,” added the
Prince.</p>

<p>“But the squadron sailed from Funchal on the 21st
of last month; and to-day is the 8th of this month,—nearly
three weeks ago. Where it is, is the conundrum
we have to guess at the prisint moment.”</p>

<p>“If the fleet went to the Western Islands on the
21st of last month, it hasn’t staid there all this time,
I’ll warrant,” said Mr. Shakings.</p>

<p>“The next isles of the sea the squadron will visit
after the Azores will be the Bermudas, I know,” continued
the captain, as he took up a pencil, and began
to figure on a bit of paper.</p>

<p>“Then all we have to do is to run for the Bermudas.
How far off are they?” asked the Prince.</p>

<p>“I have not worked up the distance on a great circle;
but I should say the distance was about two thousand
miles.”</p>

<p>“Whew!” whistled the Prince. “That is a long
distance.”</p>

<p>“It is an eight-days’ run for the Ville d’Angers.”</p>

<p>“But the fleet may be waiting for us at the Western
Islands,” suggested Capt. Fairfield.</p>

<p>“That’s true for you,” replied O’Hara. “It may
have gone back to Funchal to look for us.”</p>

<p>“And we are in a bad box,” laughed the Prince.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[346]</span>
“If we run for the Bermudas, the fleet may be looking
for us at Funchal, the Canary, or the Western Islands.
If we go back to these islands, they may go on to Bermudas,
and be waiting for us there.”</p>

<p>“Whichever course we take, very likely we shall be
sorry we didn’t take the other,” added O’Hara. “It
will require four days to go to Funchal, eight to Fayal,
and seven more to Bermudas, making allowance for
stops. What do you say, gentlemen?”</p>

<p>“I vote for Bermudas direct,” said the Prince.</p>

<p>“So do I,” added Shakings.</p>

<p>“<i>Via</i> Funchal,” Capt. Fairfield followed.</p>

<p>“<i>Via</i> Funchal is my judgment,” wound up the captain.</p>

<p>“Funchal it is, then. You are the captain,” continued
the Prince.</p>

<p>After looking the matter over again, Prince Frisbone
changed his opinion; and even Shakings admitted that
it would be safer to go to Funchal. Capt. O’Hara
gave out the course accordingly. But it was agreed by
all, that it was useless to put in at the Canaries; and
the ship was headed direct for her port in the Madeiras.
In four days she arrived at Funchal. O’Hara
and Raymond hastened on shore. They went to the
consul’s office first. The American Prince and the
Marian had been there the day before, and had sailed
for Fayal again. The principal had left a letter for
the captain of the Ville d’Angers. O’Hara took it,
and eagerly broke the seal. The missive simply instructed
him to run for Fayal, if Mr. Frisbone did not
object; and, if the fleet were not there, to remain as
long as was necessary for the students to see the island,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[347]</span>
and then, if the fleet had departed, to sail for the Bermudas,
making a harbor at St. George’s. Mr. Lowington
stated that the Ville d’Angers had been reported at
Santa Cruz de Teneriffe, and that he had ceased to be
anxious for the safety of the absentees.</p>

<p>All this was very satisfactory to the captain of the
steamer. He asked the consul for his prisoner; but
this gentleman stated that Mr. Lowington had settled
the case. As soon as possible, the Ville d’Angers was
on her way to the Western Islands. The fleet had
gone. After a day at Horta, the steamer followed, and
reached St. George on the 23d. No fleet was there.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXV.<br>

<small>THE LAST OF THE ISLES OF THE SEA.</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">“DON’T you believe those youngsters have gone
off on a lark, Mr. Lowington?” asked Judge
Rodwood, after they had gone on shore at Funchal,
on their arrival from Fayal in search of the missing
steamer.</p>

<p>“I do not think so now, though such was my fear in
the first of it,” replied the principal.</p>

<p>They had been to the banker’s, and ascertained all
they could about the Ville d’Angers; and were now on
their way to the office of the consul.</p>

<p>“I think it must be a great temptation to such
young fellows as this O’Hara and Tom Speers,” added
the judge. “You say that the captain of the steamer
has the absolute command of her.”</p>

<p>“He has in the absence of any vice-principal; for
it does not answer to place a landsman over a sailor at
sea,” replied Mr. Lowington. “But for all this, Capt.
Fairfield, the instructor on board, would have influence
enough to prevent the students from going off on a
runaway excursion.”</p>

<p>“Frisbone would prevent it, if the instructor could
not; for he is a very decided man, and, if any thing is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[349]</span>
wrong, he does not mind cutting through any amount
of red tape.”</p>

<p>“As a rule, we have a stronger hold on these young
men than mere force,” continued Mr. Lowington.
“Take your ward, for instance: he is ambitious to
obtain promotion; and any thing in the shape of a
lark would spoil all his chances. He was so interested
in his future prospects in the Tritonia, that he has been
running away from the vast fortune in store for him;
and certainly he would not peril all his hopes by engaging
in a runaway expedition.”</p>

<p>“But he is under the orders of this O’Hara.”</p>

<p>“And O’Hara is controlled by the same motives.
My banker has inquired into the condition of the
steamer, and ascertained that every thing was regular
on board of her. The boat that brought the captain
on shore lay at the landing-place two or three hours;
and I am told that not a seaman got out of it. That
looks like discipline, which would not prevail if the
officers and crew were on a lark.”</p>

<p>“No doubt you are correct, Mr. Lowington. But it
seems very strange to me, that my ward should prefer
the strict discipline of one of your vessels to the
freedom which I came out here to give him; and I
confess that I consider him ten times the man I supposed
him to be when I left New York,” said Judge
Rodwood. “As I said before, the Marian belonged to
Mr. Speers, senior, and I intended to turn her over to
my ward. You see, the young fellow will have an
income of over two hundred thousand dollars a year as
soon as he is of age; and that will be in the course of
six or eight months.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[350]</span>“Poor fellow!” said Mr. Lowington with a smile.</p>

<p>“As he is fond of the sea, I don’t suppose he can
spend his money any better than in running this steam-yacht.”</p>

<p>“He is getting the right sort of experience now to
enable him to handle her,” added Mr. Lowington, as
they entered a hotel, on their way to the consul’s, to
see if there were any familiar faces there.</p>

<p>There was one familiar face there, and it belonged
to one David Gregory. He was staying at the hotel
with his English friends. All three of them sat at a
table in the public room, drinking a bottle of wine
together; and the mutineer had already had enough to
make him rather noisy. The principal immediately
turned about so that the runaway did not see him, and
led the way out of the hotel.</p>

<p>“What is the matter?” asked Judge Rodwood, when
they were in the street. “You act like a man who sees
a hard creditor in the distance.”</p>

<p>“One of the young fellows you saw at the table
drinking wine must have escaped from the Ville d’Angers
when she was here,” replied Mr. Lowington. “He
was the first officer of the steamer, and the one who
made the trouble of which we read in the English
paper.”</p>

<p>“And what are you going to do about it?” inquired
the judge.</p>

<p>“I shall have him locked up on board of the American
Prince. I see he has made friends here.”</p>

<p>At the consul’s, the requisite arrangements were
made for the arrest of Gregory, and a couple of officers
were sent for that purpose. It was necessary for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[351]</span>
principal to go with them to identify the fugitive. The
party walked into the room where the merry party were
still drinking.</p>

<p>“I think I shall be compelled to break up your
party, Gregory,” said the principal in his mild way.</p>

<p>The mutineer sprang to his feet as though a cannon
had been discharged under his ear. Of course he had
not expected the American Prince to return to the
island, or even the Ville d’Angers. It was no use to
contend against the principal and the policemen, though
Sir Philip Grayner was inclined to resist.</p>

<p>“Mr. Lowington, I tried to do my duty on board of
the steamer; and when O’Hara attempted to run away
with the vessel, and make a voyage to England contrary
to his orders, I wanted to bring the steamer back.
I failed, and here I am,” pleaded Gregory.</p>

<p>“I do not care to hear any explanation in this place.
On board of the ship I will listen to all you have to
say,” replied the principal.</p>

<p>The officers sent him on board the Prince, where
he was locked up in a suitable apartment under the
charge of Peaks, the big boatswain of the vessel. The
sprigs doubtless made their tour of the Isles of the
Sea and of the United States; but Gregory did not
accompany them.</p>

<p>On the day of the arrival of the Prince and the
Marian, a clipper schooner came into the port from
Teneriffe. She had put into Santa Cruz de Palma;
and Mr. Lowington had a long talk with her captain,
who reported the Ville d’Angers as having sailed from
the latter port on the 3d of the month, for the Cape
Verds. The Spanish captain had been on board of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[352]</span>
the steamer; and he declared that every thing was in
perfect order. The students were studying and reciting.
Capt. O’Hara was anxious to find the fleet.</p>

<p>“Why did he go to the Cape Verds?” asked the
principal.</p>

<p>“Because this fleet was reported as having gone
there,” replied the Spanish captain.</p>

<p>If the steamer had gone to the Cape Verds, and
every thing was in good order on board of her, it was
no use to wait for her; and the American Prince and
the Marian sailed as soon as they could get up steam.</p>

<p>On the 13th of the month they reached Fayal again,
where the schooners were waiting for them. Gregory
was sent on board of the Josephine as soon as the
anchor of the Prince touched the rocks at the bottom.
Mr. Fluxion received him with a smile, for discipline
had been victorious in the end. All hands were called;
and the uniform was stripped from the recreant officer.
Gregory attempted to excuse himself on the plea that
Capt. O’Hara was running away with the steamer.</p>

<p>“All you had to do was to obey orders. But you
did not believe that Capt. O’Hara was running away
with the vessel: you knew better than this. Your
number in the Josephine is 36 from this date,” said
Mr. Fluxion sternly. “But I will say to you, and to
all, that the next promotions in all the vessels of the
fleet will be made by the results of an examination to
be held on the 1st of June. Whatever place you win,
you shall have at that time, though your demerits for
conduct will be considered in making the award.”</p>

<p>The fleet at once departed for the Bermudas. The
wind was fair, and the weather generally good, with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[353]</span>
exception of a gale, and a two-days’ fog, so that the
schooners made the passage in ten days. The fleet
kept together all the way, and sighted St. David’s
Head at the same time. This is the north-eastern
point of the islands, off which the pilots cruise in good
weather, and near which are the two eastern passages
into the inner waters, enclosed by an almost continuous
reef to the northward and westward of the islands.
Each vessel took a pilot, and, going through narrow
channels between the reefs, came into the harbor of
St. George, the most northern town in the islands.</p>

<p>“Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah!” came from a steamer
at anchor, as the Prince went across her bow.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” asked the principal.</p>

<p>“It must be the truant steamer,” replied Dr. Winstock.</p>

<p>“Three cheers for the Tritonia!” shouted a voice
on board of the steamer, as the vessel indicated came
into the harbor.</p>

<p>“The Ville d’Angers has got here before us,” said
Mr. Pelham. “She must have passed us in that fog.”</p>

<p>“Three cheers for the Marian!” called Capt.
O’Hara, as the beautiful steam-yacht came into view.</p>

<p>They were all given with a will; and there could be
no doubt the students on board were glad to see their
shipmates after the long separation. In a short time
the vessels of the fleet were anchored, and the boats
began to drop from the davits into the water.</p>

<p>“Arrah, Tom, my darlint! your guardian has caught
you at last!” exclaimed O’Hara, when he saw the barge
of the Marian approaching the steamer.</p>

<p>“I shall be as resigned as possible to my fate,”
replied Tom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">[354]</span>“To the millions of money, you mane!”</p>

<p>“I shall not quarrel with that.”</p>

<p>“If you fall out with it, remimber your best frind.”</p>

<p>“I shall certainly do that, my dear fellow, whatever
happens to me. But I shall not leave the squadron if
I can help it.”</p>

<p>“Faix, I hope you won’t while I am in it!” added
Capt. O’Hara, grasping the hand of the second officer.
“But here comes his honor the judge. Be ready for
him, Tom, and trate him loike a gintieman.”</p>

<p>“I shall certainly do that,” replied Tom, as he went
to the gangway, where the steps had already been
rigged, though the steamer had been in port but a few
hours.</p>

<p>“Which is my boy?” demanded the judge, as he
came on deck.</p>

<p>“Here he is,” replied O’Hara, pointing out the
second officer.</p>

<p>“Tom, my lad, I am delighted to see you, after wandering
all over the ocean in search of you!” exclaimed
Judge Rodwood, grasping both the hands of his ward,
and giving him a very affectionate greeting. “What
do you mean by running away from me?”</p>

<p>“I am very glad to see you, sir; though I do not
want to be taken out of the squadron,” replied Tom,
who found the judge a very different person from what
he had anticipated.</p>

<p>He was not a bit like the stern judge he had fancied;
and he could not help liking him at first sight.</p>

<p>“You can stay in the squadron till your head is as
white as mine, if you like, my lad,” protested the
guardian warmly. “The Marian, which is not a very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">[355]</span>
ugly craft, is your property, or will be in a few months;
and I didn’t know but you might like to make a cruise
in her. Do as you please, however.”</p>

<p>“That alters the case,” replied Tom, laughing, and
bestowing an admiring glance upon the beautiful steam-yacht.
“But I think I should like to remain a while
longer.”</p>

<p>By this time the principal and the two vice-principals
were on board. They greeted the captain with great
heartiness; and it was clear enough that he was not
under the displeasure of the authorities. O’Hara made
his report in full on the spot, detailing all the incidents
of the cruise. He sent for the log-books kept by all
the officers, and submitted them for examination. The
captain had the satisfaction of having his management
of the steamer approved.</p>

<p>The meeting between Mr. Frisbone and the principal
was a very interesting event; and the ship’s company
of the Ville d’Angers understood its meaning so
well, that they involuntarily gave three cheers as the
two gentlemen joined hands on the deck.</p>

<p>“Your boys have been the salvation of myself and
those I care a good deal more for than I do for myself,
Mr. Lowington!” exclaimed the prince; and the tears
gathered in his eyes as he spoke.</p>

<p>“I am glad that they have been of service to you,”
replied the principal, as they retired to the cabin to see
the ladies.</p>

<p>“That Tom Speers, who is worth three millions of
dollars now, would weigh down the whole of the money
in gold,” continued the Prince; and he proceeded to
tell the story of Tom’s noble conduct in saving the
life of Miss Rodwood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">[356]</span>“I hope the money that comes to him will not spoil
him. He had been brought up in poverty; and the
change may turn his head,” added the principal.</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it!” exclaimed Mr. Frisbone. “Tom’s
head is not one of the sort to be turned by money, or
any thing else. He will do more good with that fortune
than his uncle ever did; and I thank God it has fallen
into good hands.”</p>

<p>“Let us hope so.”</p>

<p>“And believe so; for I know the young man through
and through.”</p>

<p>“This is a fine steamer you have, Mr. Frisbone,”
added the principal, looking about the cabin.</p>

<p>“It is a fine steamer <i>you</i> have, Mr. Lowington,”
yelled the Prince, in his loudest tone. “She belongs
to you, every timber and bolt in her! she was saved by
your boys, or she would have gone to the bottom.
More than this, I have a considerable sum of money
from the salvage of the Castle William, which I shall
pay over to you, deducting the expenses I have incurred
in fitting up the ship, coaling and provisioning her.”</p>

<p>The Prince produced his accounts, and insisted upon
paying over his balance in sovereigns to the principal;
who received it under protest.</p>

<p>“What shall I do with the steamer?” asked Mr.
Lowington.</p>

<p>“Use her instead of them two topsail schooners!”
screamed the Prince, as he always did when he had a
bright idea.</p>

<p>“In due time we will consider that question. Now
you are almost back to New York, where you started
from; and I understand that you were in quest of
health for your wife’s sister.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">[357]</span>“That’s so; but I don’t think any thing particular
ails her now. We have given her something to think
about all the time; and I guess she is pretty much
cured now. I shall spend the winter in that place on
the back side of the peak of Teneriffe; and if I get
there by the 1st of December, it will be soon enough.”</p>

<p>“Then this steamer must convey you to your destination,”
said the principal.</p>

<p>“Well, I sha’n’t mind staying with you all summer,
if you don’t object. This sort of life agrees with my
wife and her sister, now they have got used to it; and
I don’t get seasick myself.”</p>

<p>The rest of the day was spent in exchanging visits
between the vessels; and not much study was done.
The Prince and his ladies visited the Marian and the
American Prince. Tom Speers went with them; for it
could not be denied that he was a prime favorite with
the ladies, and especially with Miss Louise. Clinch
was sent back to the Josephine, and became No. 35.</p>

<p>The next morning, when things had settled down
again, the signal for the lecture was displayed on board
of the American Prince. The grand saloon of the
steamer was crowded on this occasion, for all the passengers,
officers, and engineers of the Marian and the
Ville d’Angers were present.</p>

<p>“Before the professor begins his lecture, I wish to
say that all the offices of the squadron will be given
out in accordance with the results of an examination
to be conducted at Hamilton, beginning on the 1st of
June. It will include all branches of study and seamanship;
and the marks for conduct will be added to the
result of the examination,” said the principal. “I am<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[358]</span>
sorry I was not able to give this notice to the ship’s
company of the Tritonia on the 1st of May, as I did in
the other vessels.”</p>

<p>“But we all knew there was to be a new method
adopted; and some of us were sure it was to be an examination,”
added O’Hara, when he had obtained permission
to speak.</p>

<p>“So much the better if you understood the matter.
I will add that we have another vessel to officer, and
that the examination will be general; that is, the offices
will be assigned throughout the squadron, instead of
confining the result to a single vessel. The one who
stands highest will have his choice of all the places in
the squadron; and so on till all the positions are given
out. I wish you all to consider the subject during the
next week, so that you can choose your places without
any delay. I have adopted this method, after consulting
the faculty, rather because it affords a little variety
than because it is a superior plan to the one we have
been using.”</p>

<p>The principal retired, and Professor Mapps took his
place before the chart he had made of the Bermudas.</p>

<p>“These islands are different in many respects from
any you have yet visited,” the professor began. “They
are coralline,—the most northerly of this type in the
world. The rock formed is a gray limestone, which is
very soft. They are in latitude thirty-two, twenty; and
in longitude sixty-four, fifty. The group consists of
five principal islands, and about five hundred small
ones, varying in size from a few square feet up to a
square mile in extent. The largest island is Bermuda,
which is fifteen miles long, and occupies the most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">[359]</span>
southern position in the group. On it is Hamilton,
the capital. The land on our starboard side, where
you see the town, is St. George, three miles and a half
in length; on the other side of us is St. David’s, about
two and a half miles long. The other two are in the
south-west, Somerset and Ireland, each two or three
miles in length. None of the islands are more than two
miles wide, and in some places you can hardly choose
on which side you would fall overboard. The group is
twenty miles long; and they contain only twenty-four
square miles of land, with a population of about twelve
thousand. More than half of the people are negroes.</p>

<p>“There are few wells, or at least few that produce
good water. You observe that the houses in the town
of St. George are all white or nearly so, including the
roofs. They have not been whitewashed, as you may
suppose; but they are plastered. This is done to keep
them clean; for all the water used is gathered on them,
and kept in cisterns or tanks. Where large quantities
are required, and the roofs do not afford a sufficient
supply, portions of the hillside are plastered in the
same manner, and the water that is collected on them
is saved. The water from the clouds is the purest that
can be had, if it can be kept free from impurities after
it falls.</p>

<p>“Agriculture, possibly for the want of labor, is in a
very backward state. The negroes are not disposed to
work any more than enough to procure the bare necessities
of life. You will see little patches of ground
spaded up, for they don’t often use the plough, as the
irregular surface of the land hardly admits it in many
places. But it is remarkably fertile and productive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">[360]</span>
It yields three crops a year of vegetables, which find
a ready market in the neighboring ports of the United
States, only six to seven hundred miles distant. The
exports of the Bermudas amount to about three hundred
and fifty thousand dollars a year. There is a
regular steamer to and from New York, but the government
has to subsidize the company that runs it.</p>

<p>“This is a very important naval and military station
of Great Britain, with extensive magazines and store-houses.
On the island of Ireland is a dock-yard, provided
with a floating dry dock, built of iron in England,
and towed out to the islands. As a naval and military
station, the islands are said to be second only to
Malta. On account of this interest, the governor,
whose authority is little less than supreme, is appointed
by the crown of England; and the incumbent is invariably
a man of great ability. The two branches of the
Legislature are the House of Assembly, which is the
popular body, elected by the people of the parishes,
and the Council, nominated to the crown by the governor.
Though white and black are allowed to vote,
there are three times as many voters of the former as
of the latter. The voter must own real estate to the
amount of sixty pounds; and he must have four times
this amount before he can be a member of the House
of Assembly. No negro has ever been elected to this
office.</p>

<p>“The climate may be said to be delightful; and as
a rule the islands are very healthy. When the yellow
fever and other diseases have prevailed here as epidemics,
it has been entirely owing to the lack of proper
drainage, and the neglect of other sanitary measures<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">[361]</span>
The mercury rarely goes above eighty-five or below
forty; and the average is about seventy. It hardly
compares with Orotava, and it is too damp for most
pulmonary affections.</p>

<p>“I will conclude this brief talk with a word about
the history of the islands. They get their name from
a Spaniard by the name of Juan Bermudez, who discovered
them about four hundred years ago. But it was
not settled by the Spaniards. Very likely the roving
buccaneers of the Spanish main had temporary homes
here; and there are stories of vast wealth hidden by
these worthies. When the more modern settlers took
possession of it, they found hogs in vast numbers,
though the islands were uninhabited; and there were
many evidences of the visits of human beings.</p>

<p>“In 1609, not long after the first settlement of Virginia,
a vessel called the Sea Adventure was fitted out
in England to convey Sir Thomas Gates, just appointed
governor of the Virginia Colony, Admiral Sir George
Somers, and other officials, to the scene of their future
labors. This vessel went with a fleet, loaded with
colonists and supplies for the new home in Virginia.
In a terrible storm, the Sea Adventure was separated
from the rest of the fleet, and was wrecked on the
Bermudas. After suffering great hardships, the shipwrecked
party reached the shores of these islands without
the loss of a single life. The voyagers found plenty
of turtle, fish, and fruit in the island, as well as a most
delicious climate; and they were so well pleased with
the paradise they had found, that they did not attempt
to get away for a year. At the end of this time they
had built a vessel, in which they embarked for Virginia,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">[362]</span>
and reached their destination in safety. But the colony
were in the utmost need of supplies, being almost in a
state of starvation. In this emergency Sir George
Somers, who is represented as a noble and unselfish
man, willing to peril his life for the salvation of others,
procuring a party of volunteers to accompany him,
sailed for the Bermudas to obtain a supply of provisions
from that land, ‘flowing with milk and honey.’
Unhappily he died when his vessel reached the locality
where we now are; and after him this island was called
St. George, though I cannot say when or how he happened
to be canonized. After him also the scene of
his death received the name of the ‘Somers Islands,’
as they are often called. The colonists reported so
favorably, that settlements were commenced in 1612;
and the islands have been under the British Government
since that time.”</p>

<p>The professor finished his remarks, and the students
hastened on shore for the first time.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVI.<br>

<small>YOUNG AMERICA HOMEWARD BOUND.</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">“THE professor did not say this used to be called
‘The Isle of Devils,’” said Dr. Winstock, when
he seated himself in the stern-sheets of the captain’s
gig, with Sheridan and Murray. “It was so called
because it was such a terrible place for shipwrecks.
But the science of navigation had not been carried to
such perfection in those days as at present.”</p>

<p>“This is a queer old place,” said Murray, when he
had obtained a view of the town.</p>

<p>“It is not a very progressive place; and things
appear here pretty much as they did a hundred years
ago. The houses are of the fashion of the past; and
I have no doubt that some of them are over a century
old. But this is a beautiful harbor; and you will be
delighted when you get on the top of some hill, to see
the panorama spread out before you. The views in the
Bermudas are peculiar. The little islands look like so
many green hillocks rising out of the water; and much
of the scenery is quite rugged. There is an island off
there, with a little white cottage upon it. For my part,
I think there is nothing more lovely in the world; and
if we could have the society of the States, as they call<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">[364]</span>
our country, I should spend the rest of my days
here.”</p>

<p>The party landed from the boat, and Wainwright
and Scott joined them. They walked into the town,
taking a general view of it. The houses seem to be
scattered about without any regard to order.</p>

<p>“This reminds me of the town of Gosport on the
Isles of Shoals, before the hand of improvement
touched it,” said the surgeon. “Every man built his
house where he chose, without heeding any possibility
of streets in the present or the future. Here is a pretty
cottage with its front garden bordered by a laborer’s
hovel. During our war a great deal of business was
done here in blockade-running; but it don’t appear to
be very driving in any thing now.”</p>

<p>A short time exhausted the streets, or rather lanes, of
the town. It contains between two and three thousand
inhabitants. The business men rarely live in either
St. George or Hamilton, the only towns in the islands;
but, when the work of the day is ended, they drive or
sail away to their cottages on the islands.</p>

<p>All around St. George are forts to defend the only
practicable entrance for large vessels to the interior
sea, about twenty-five miles by ten, enclosed by the
reefs, in which there are only a few openings, so intricate
and dangerous that they can be navigated only by
the most skilful pilots.</p>

<p>The doctor’s party walked to Cherry-stone Hill,
about a mile from the town, which commanded a view
of the islands to the eastward, the forts, and the harbor.
They sat there for hours, enjoying the prospect of sea
and land, and the delicious air of the place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">[365]</span>The next morning the entire squadron, in charge of
the pilots, sailed for Hamilton, the capital, where the
principal intended to remain for two or three weeks.
On the passage, which is about fifteen miles around,
through Grassy Bay and Great Sound, up to the head
of a considerable inlet, where the capital is situated,
the students obtained a full view of the dock-yard and
floating-dock, which contained a large man-of-war at
the time, and of the great store-houses. On the other
side, near the shore, at the back of the town, was the
governor’s house. Threading their way among the
multitude of islands, the fleet reached its destination,
and anchored in front of the town. It is built on the
gentle slope of the hills; and, with its white-roofed
buildings, presents a very neat and pretty appearance.</p>

<p>The students were permitted to go on shore as soon
as every thing had been made snug on board the vessels.
In half an hour more they were wandering
through its streets. But there was really little in the
place to see; and, as it contains only two thousand
inhabitants, it was soon exhausted.</p>

<p>After dinner, the doctor and his party took carriages
for a drive. Tom Speers and O’Hara, with Miss
Louise, the Prince and his wife, formed another party.
These excursions were repeated every afternoon for a
week. They visited the southern part of the island of
Bermuda, where a hill nearly four hundred feet high
afforded them a magnificent view of Port Royal Bay
and Great Sound, both sheets of water packed with
islands. On some of them are the neat white cottages
one sees all over the main islands. In the vicinity of
Hamilton there are many more pretentious buildings;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">[366]</span>
but these little country places are the charm of the
landscape. Though some of these structures are very
old, they seem to be in good repair; for there is no
freezing in the winter to throw a building out of shape,
or settle the foundation unequally in different places.</p>

<p>“I see they keep all sorts of animals tied up in this
country,” said Murray, as the party were out on one of
these drives. “There are some hens moored by the
leg.”</p>

<p>“You see these little gardens in all parts of the
islands. They are fenced in with oleander; but a
couple of those hens could ruin the hopes of the gardener,
after he has planted his onion-seed, or prepared
his arrow-root plantation. For this reason all the
domestic animals that live out doors are tied to keep
them out of mischief,” replied the doctor. “Our first
onions and tomatoes usually come from these islands.”</p>

<p>Sometimes the drive was taken in the opposite
direction, towards St. George. Speare and Paynter
Hills, in the vicinity of Harrington Sound, afforded the
excursionists the desired views of the country. The
sound is a beautiful sheet of water. The scenery all
around it is enchanting; and there were any number
of bowers in the dense growth of tropical trees and
shrubs, which were full of interest to the wanderers
from the sea.</p>

<p>There is no end of caves in the limestone rock;
and caves are a positive glory to boys. Tom Moore
lived for a time in this island, and wrote poetry, investing
the locality with romance and sentiment; and
Moore’s “calabash-tree” is still a favorite resort to the
visitor. Devil’s Hole, or, more poetically, Neptune’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">[367]</span>
Grotto, is a rocky abyss filled with clear water, and has
an underground connection with the sea.</p>

<p>“How full of fish it is!” exclaimed Sheridan, as he
discovered that the water was alive with several varieties
of fish.</p>

<p>“This is used to keep the fish caught in other waters,
at the proper season, to be taken from this store-house
when they are not available elsewhere,” answered
the surgeon. “You will find a great many ponds in
Bermuda applied to this use. You have observed how
clear the water is.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t this a capital road?” said Wainwright, as
the carriage moved on towards Hamilton.</p>

<p>“You will find such in all countries where the English
people have lived long enough to make them.
There are a hundred and fifty miles of these good
hard roads in the twenty-four square miles of the
Bermudas. You see they have to be cut through the
rock in some places,” said the doctor, as the carriage
passed through such a cutting, the walls on both sides
being covered with vines, and with an abundance of
plants growing out of the interstices.</p>

<p>Dr. Winstock botanized somewhat with those of his
charge who had a taste for the study; and there was
abundant material to illustrate the subject. The road
all along from the Sound to Hamilton was bordered
with flowers; and when the party stopped at a house,
to look at its wealth of floral treasures, it was not unusual
for the courteous inhabitants to come out, and invite
them to enter the grounds, or to accept a hastily gathered
bouquet. Indeed, nothing could exceed the courtesy
and kindness of the people in town and country.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">[368]</span>
They all seemed to be interested in the students, and
especially in the ladies from the Ville d’Angers.</p>

<p>The excursions were not confined to those made in
carriages. The students were roaming all over the
islands, during the afternoons, which were wholly given
up to sight-seeing. All could not afford carriages;
and there were not enough of them to supply all, even
if money had been plenty with them. Most of the
boys walked; and in their rambles they had a deal of
fun among themselves, and with the multitude of
negroes that collected whenever the young tars were
engaged in a frolic.</p>

<p>Quite as pleasant as the rides in the carriages were
the excursions made in the boats of the fleet. On one
occasion all the boats of the squadron, sixteen in
number, made an excursion to the dock-yard. In the
waters of Grassy Bay they gave an exhibition of the
skill of the students in handling the cutters, which
drew cheers of approbation from the naval officers and
others who witnessed it. When the display was over,
the boats’ crew visited the dock-yard, and one of the
men-of-war in port. They were courteously shown all
over the yard, and the operation of the floating-dock
was explained to them.</p>

<p>On the last day of the month the fleet left the harbor
of Hamilton, and sought an anchorage in a retired
bay, about three miles from the town. Here the
squadron was entirely landlocked, and the water was
as smooth as a millpond. The four academical craft
were moored alongside each other, so that the professors
could pass from one to the others without the
use of the boats. Early in the morning the examination<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">[369]</span>
was begun. It was continued for three days; but it
was understood that the result would give the officers
and students their positions for three months, instead
of one as before; for such a thorough examination was
not possible more than once in a quarter.</p>

<p>All the ambitious students had been at work very
diligently for the last two months, preparing for this
great event. Tom Speers and Capt. O’Hara had given
very little time to frolic and sight-seeing during the
time the fleet had been at the Bermudas; but had been
studying night and day. The officers of the American
Prince had not been so diligent; for most of them had
held their positions so long that they felt almost sure
of them in the future, whatever system of promotions
might be adopted.</p>

<p>On the morning of the fourth day, all hands were
mustered under the awnings on the deck of the American
Prince to learn the result of the examination. The
principal took the rostrum which had been built for
this occasion; and an anxious silence followed his
appearance. He held in his hand the paper on which
the fate of every officer and seaman was written down.</p>

<p>“Young gentlemen,” Mr. Lowington began, “I am
well aware that the changes proposed to-day will amount
to a revolution. About the middle of the month, after
the new crews of the several vessel have been trained
to their duties under the different order of things, the
squadron will sail for Brockway, the former headquarters
of the fleet. When we have obtained a new register
for the Ville d’Angers, she will be called the Frisbone.”</p>

<p>In spite of the anxiety that pervaded the audience
of the principal, this announcement was received with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">[370]</span>
the most tremendous applause. The Prince, who was
present with his wife and Miss Louise, felt called upon
to make a speech, acknowledging the honor conferred
upon him. He would rather have his name on the
stern of a vessel used for the purpose to which the
“Frisbone” was to be applied, than on that of the
biggest ocean steamer that could bear it to the most
remote regions of the earth.</p>

<p>“The Frisbone will take the place of the Josephine
and the Tritonia, after she has been properly fitted for
the purpose. With the two steamers, which will not
have to wait for any sailing-vessels, we may make a
voyage around the world; for I intend to re-organize
the squadron, on a much more extensive plan of study.
But this will not be done till the end of the quarter
upon which we have now begun.</p>

<p>“The Frisbone will now be officered in the same
manner as the schooner, with a captain, four lieutenants,
and four masters. The office of purser and midshipman
on board of the Prince will be abolished, so
that there will be only nine cabin officers on board of
each vessel. The two engineers of the Frisbone will
be relieved from further duty in that department. The
Prince will have forty-eight petty officers and seamen,
and each of the other vessels thirty-six. Since the
late Commodore Cantwell left the academy squadron,
the office he held has not been filled, for the reason
that those who came out the highest preferred the more
active position of captain. We shall in future dispense
with this ornamental figure-head.</p>

<p>“In addition to the choice of offices, each student
will be entitled to elect in which of the four vessels he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">[371]</span>
will serve for the coming quarter, until the complements
are complete. Some exchanges may be allowed
in the end, for I am not disposed to separate friends
unnecessarily; but all such must be on equal terms,
and by agreement between those exchanged.”</p>

<p>The principal paused to put on his glasses, and the
students improved the opportunity to applaud the plan
laid down.</p>

<p>“The first name on the list is Sheridan,” continued
Mr. Lowington; and the usual demonstration when
popular officers obtained good positions was made.
“Capt. Sheridan, I congratulate you on the high rank
you have won; and you have the right to choose any
position in the fleet.”</p>

<p>“I prefer to remain where I am,” replied Sheridan.
And Mr. Pelham made a record of his choice.</p>

<p>“The next name is that of Thomas Speers,” said Mr.
Lowington.</p>

<p>The announcement seemed to create as much surprise
as when the same name had been mentioned in
the harbor of Gibraltar, two months before. But all
the ship’s company of the Ville d’Angers manifested
a tremendous enthusiasm.</p>

<p>“Good boy, darlint!” screamed O’Hara, grasping
Tom’s hand, and wringing it with hearty good-will.
“That’s what all your hard study manes; and I rather
you had this place than have it myself.”</p>

<p>“What place do you elect?” asked the principal.</p>

<p>“I am sure you will come next, and I shall take the
position of first lieutenant of our steamer,” whispered
Tom to his late captain.</p>

<p>“Bother with you! don’t do any thing of the sort!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">[372]</span>
my name may not come till the fortieth, and then where
shall we be?” protested O’Hara. “He will take the
place of captain of the Frisbone,” he added, turning to
the principal.</p>

<p>“You must speak for yourself, Mr. Speers,” said the
principal, with a smile.</p>

<p>“Will you tell me what name comes next on the list,
Mr. Lowington?” asked Tom.</p>

<p>“I cannot do that,” replied the principal, shaking his
head. “And I hope no student will give way for another.”</p>

<p>“Captain of the Frisbone,” replied Tom, who would
gladly have given up the position in favor of O’Hara.</p>

<p>Wainwright came in third, and selected his present
office in the Tritonia.</p>

<p>“O’Hara is the fourth on the list,” the principal proceeded.</p>

<p>Tom Speers engineered a very warm demonstration
in favor of his friend, when the announcement was made,
as O’Hara had done when his own was mentioned.</p>

<p>“I am knocked out of my place!” exclaimed Vroome,
the captain of the Josephine.</p>

<p>But O’Hara, without an instant’s hesitation, selected
the position of first lieutenant of the Frisbone, and then
he wanted to hug Tom.</p>

<p>“Murray,” read the principal from the list.</p>

<p>The Josephines shook again; but Murray preferred
his old place as first lieutenant of the Prince, for he
and the captain were very dear friends, and were
always together with the doctor when they went on
shore. Vroome fortunately came next, and the Josephines
were put out of misery.</p>

<p>The principal went through the list, and it was found<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">[373]</span>
by the students, that the officers were not very different
from what they had been before, except in the few cases
where extraordinary efforts had been made. With
hardly an exception, they preferred to remain in the
vessels they had belonged to before. Scott came out
third lieutenant of the Tritonia, and Blair recovered
his lost place in the cabin, Richards having fallen out
of it. Gregory and Clinch were seamen, and chose to
serve in the Prince.</p>

<p>“Tom Speers, you are ten times the man I took you
to be,” said Judge Rodwood, grasping the hand of his
ward, when he got near enough to him to do so. “I
am sure your uncle’s fortune, or that part of it that
came to you, will go to the right place. I congratulate
you, Capt. Speers, and I know you are worthy of the
place you have won.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir,” replied Tom, glowing with excitement.
“I set out for the position, or one just like it,
and I have got it. Of course you will not expect me
to leave the squadron now?”</p>

<p>“Certainly not; but as soon as you are twenty-one I
shall hand the Marian over to you; and any time
before that, when you choose to leave the command of
the Frisbone, she is at your service.”</p>

<p>Capt. Speers decided not to make any use of her at
present. In the afternoon the new officers were put
into position on board of the vessels of the fleet.
Tom took possession of the captain’s cabin; and
O’Hara “gushed” all the afternoon, he was so pleased
with the present order of things on board.</p>

<p>On the 15th of the month, the fleet, including the
Marian, sailed for Brockway. After a pleasant June
passage, the vessels arrived.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">[374]</span>And now, having taken the academy squadron twice
across the Atlantic, our series of stories comes to an
end. In the course of the summer the principal re-organized
his squadron, as he had intended. In
November Tom Speers, as captain of the Frisbone, as
she was now legally named, conveyed Mr. Frisbone,
his wife, her sister, and Dr. Phelps, to Orotava, in the
island of Teneriffe, where they had decided to spend
the winter. When he had landed his passengers, he
sailed for Havana, where the American Prince was to
join him; and the two vessels were to spend the winter
in the West Indies.</p>

<p>Early in the spring the two steamers went to the
Canaries again; where a happy meeting between Tom
and Miss Louise occurred, and it was rumored that
they were in very great peril of becoming more nearly
related in a few months or years. At this point Tom concluded,
that, as he was twenty-one, he would retire from
the command, and go on a cruise in the Marian. The
last we heard of him, he was in the China Sea, with
O’Hara, who had graduated in the fall of the same
year as Tom, still sticking to him like a brother. The
young millionnaire does not spend all his income upon
himself, and the poor and the needy have good reason
to thank God that old Tom Speers gave half of his
colossal fortune to his nephew.</p>

<p>Having taken our readers all over Europe, we bid
them all good-by as we step ashore from our voyage
among “The Isles of the Sea.”</p>
